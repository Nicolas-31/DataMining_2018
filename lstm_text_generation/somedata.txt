The Amphletts ran the organization from their own home, and struggled to gain funding, before closing PAIN in 1999. PAIN was to an extent a reflection of the ‘new politics’ of identity and lifestyle, concurrent with the rise of New Social Movements, as falsely accused parents utilized communication technologies to make their experiences public, and to contact and support one another. At the same time, PAIN also sought to exert political influence through relatively traditional channels—contributing to public inquiries, encouraging their membership to write letters to Members of Parliament, and shaping media critique. Despite its small size, PAIN was able to act as an intermediary between parents and politicians, social workers, solicitors and physicians. PAIN represented, but also collated and shaped, parents’ experiences. The case study of PAIN suggests that small groups have been able to mediate between ‘public’ and ‘experts’, effectively working with both groups because of their ability to combine experience and professionalism. These groups have brought experiential knowledge into social policy, and more broadly shifted the roles and responsibilities accorded to children, families and parents.
==== Body
Parents Against Injustice (PAIN) was an advocacy group which, between July 1985 and November 1999, sought to represent parents falsely accused of child abuse. PAIN was founded by Susan and Steve Amphlett after the couple were mistakenly accused of physically injuring their youngest daughter.1 PAIN held the following ‘principal objectives’:
To campaign for reform in abuse and care procedures with accepted and enforceable codes of practice.

To ensure that the ‘principles of natural justice’ were given ‘due regard’ within these care procedures.

To encourage public debate on the rights of parents, children and families involved in child abuse cases.

To offer support and advice and to act as a referral helpline to parents unjustly accused of abuse.2


With these objectives, the organization served both as a lobbying group, seeking to influence policy-makers, care professionals, and media, and also as a support group, giving falsely accused parents emotional support and advice.3 In both its campaigning and its support work, PAIN mediated between falsely accused parents and physicians, lawyers, social workers and policy-makers. The group’s significance was recognized by contemporary social policy researchers, and relatively regular media coverage, and PAIN dealt with almost 13,000 cases over its lifespan.4 PAIN found influential patrons—Ludovic Kennedy, a writer and broadcaster with a keen interest in justice and false convictions and, later, Dame Margaret Booth, a High Court judge who had chaired the advisory committee on the Children Act of 1989.5

Despite these successes, PAIN was a very small organization. Archival material only exists for PAIN’s accounts in the financial years ending in April 1987, 1988 and 1989, although subsequent newspaper coverage and Parliamentary debates provide some indication of later accounts. From these sources, it is clear that PAIN relied on a sporadic and limited range of funding from public donations, government, charitable trusts and membership fees. PAIN’s income was just £4,428 in the financial year ending April 1987, £19,169 in 1988, and £52,528 in 1989—rising as the organization became more successful at seeking out grants from the Department of Health and various Trusts.6 PAIN was staffed full-time by Susan Amphlett, who was assisted by Steve Amphlett at the weekends and in the evenings, and also by between one and three secretaries as funding allowed. Secretaries engaged in a diverse range of tasks: filing, speaking to parents, organizing postage and photocopying, and drafting press releases.7

In 1996 the Department of Health substantially reduced the grants provided to PAIN, forcing the organization to fire its full-time employees. It is unclear why the Department stopped funding PAIN. Amphlett believed that the organization had lost momentum, and that prospective funders no longer regarded PAIN as ‘new and innovative’.8 Certainly, as I will describe later, new legislation brought parents further into child protection proceedings. Another journalist, Richard Ingrams, cynically suggested that: ‘It is, perhaps, not surprising that the State should cease to support an organisation which is trying to curb the excesses of state interference’.9 PAIN attempted to ‘stagger on’ with the support of a few volunteers and trustees, but the organization was struggling.10 In 1999 the Department of Health stopped funding PAIN entirely. Susan Amphlett told the sympathetic journalist David Brindle in 1999 that ‘We have tried every which way and there is simply nowhere left to make applications to’.11

In February 2000, Alison Stevens—a former volunteer for PAIN—restarted a new form of the organization, which has continued to offer support to parents and to release press and media statements.12 PAIN has not received formal funding since 1999, but has operated through a website, blogs, email and telephone.13 The group was still relatively influential—Stevens, for example, was labelled the ‘inspirational woman of the year’ by the Mail on Sunday in 2009—yet their reach was restricted by lack of resources. The first and second versions of PAIN were very different organizations, both of which merit academic attention. For example, examination of the second incarnation of PAIN could inform our knowledge of the relationship between the Internet and campaign organizations. However, this article will solely focus on emergence, campaigning and downfall of the original PAIN.

Whilst PAIN was a national group, local sites of parental activism also emerged in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s in response to widespread panics around child abuse in Leeds and in Cleveland and accusations of satanic ritual abuse in Orkney and Rochdale.14 National parents’ groups were also formed to campaign around specific issues, for example, The Five Percenters sought to defend parents falsely accused of shaking their babies.15 The local groups were very small—each representing between twenty and fifty local parents—and tended to only last for a couple of years when numerous accusations of child abuse were simultaneously made in particular areas. The Cleveland group, for example, was formed when two local paediatricians diagnosed 121 children, from fifty-eight families, as having been sexually abused, between late 1986 and Spring 1987.16 The judgement of the paediatricians was very controversial, as they relied on the new technique of reflex anal dilation, and indeed by 1991 ninety-four of the children had been returned to their families.17 During this case, forty-five of the accused parents were attending weekly meetings organized by a local clergyman, Reverend Michael Wright.18

Parent advocacy groups emerged, for the first time, as issues of child abuse and child protection began to accrue increasing levels of social and political concern from the 1960s.19 Before this time, there was some anxiety around ‘cruelty to children’, but this was seen as the responsibility of voluntary societies and philanthropists, rather than as an issue for all of society to prevent.20 In this context, social services and physicians were increasingly looking to identify cases of child maltreatment but, as Ian Hacking has written, to be accused of child abuse was to be accused of committing the ‘worst possible vice’.21 It is impossible to find statistics on the number of false accusations, but parents groups believed that there were many within this ‘anxious climate’.22

PAIN was thus the largest group within a broader movement towards parental activism. Phillip Jenkins and Nigel Parton have both paid brief attention to PAIN, and written that the group achieved ‘striking success in presenting its views to the mass media’, and was the ‘most coherent voice’ in ‘the parents’ lobby’.23 Aside from this, however, the organization has not yet been subjected to sustained academic attention. In part, this is perhaps because PAIN was a short-lived and also relatively small organization. Writing a history of PAIN is also complicated by a lack of available resources. When PAIN closed, the Amphletts destroyed the group’s case files, containing the demographic details and histories of the PAIN families, reflecting late-twentieth-century concerns around familial privacy and secrecy, as well as a cathartic, or perhaps frustrated, closure to the campaigning careers of the Amphletts.24 No archives hold a substantial body of PAIN’s published materials. I have traced the history of PAIN through a disparate range of sources: newspaper articles, a television documentary, submissions to public inquiries, published materials, and four of the groups’ newsletters available at the British Library. From these materials, this article argues that PAIN provides a useful lens through which to study the nature of expertise, voluntary action and policy amidst the changing construction of respectability, parenting and state in late-twentieth-century Britain.

Frank Prochaska has claimed that civic participation in Britain declined in the post-war period, in comparison to the ‘golden age’ of the Victorian era.25 Matthew Hilton, James McKay, Nicholas Crowson, and Jean-Francois Mouhot have persuasively countered this thesis by arguing that a change has occurred in the nature, not the extent, of civic participation, as the post-war period saw the passive membership of non-government organizations replace the active membership of political parties, trade unions, and churches. The membership of non-governmental organizations can be mobilized at key junctures of crisis, but the public are more likely to support a group through arms-length, ‘cheque-book activism’ than to attend regular meetings or to actively campaign.26 The case study of PAIN demonstrates that, to some extent, a tradition of small, locally run, informally organized activism continued to be influential in the post-war period.

Furthermore, I will argue that PAIN was shaped by a mesh of old and new politics and forms of voluntarism. PAIN drew upon the ‘new politics’ of identity and lifestyle manifested in the New Social Movements of the 1960s and 1970s but, at the same time, also encouraged parents to help one another, reminiscent of older ‘self-help’ movements. Also, PAIN sought to influence policy-makers in a relatively ‘traditional’ manner, seeking negotiation and consensus from within the system. My argument draws upon Alex Mold’s characterization of Release, an organization established in 1967 to provide legal assistance to people arrested for drug offences. Mold argued that Release ‘by concerning itself with questions of identity and lifestyle was representative of an interest in new types of political and social problems, but these were often resolved by using old political strategies’.27 Mold suggests that Release was a ‘buffer’ between the alternative society of the 1960s and ‘the establishment’.28 In this article, I wish to further examine the notion of the ‘buffer’, and to understand why and how voluntary groups were able to perform this role. I will argue that groups are able to work with factions of the public, mobilized by identity, and also with physicians, social workers, media and policy-makers because of their ability to combine personal experience with professional expertise. First, I will demonstrate that PAIN was able to encourage falsely accused parents to speak about their traumatic experiences, for the first time, because the groups’ publicity materials described the life histories of the Amphletts. At the same time, PAIN was able to establish structures through which parents could help one another, such as local support groups, letter exchanges and a helpline, which united parents and also demonstrated relatively high levels of organization. Second, this article argues that PAIN was able to influence policy-makers because the organization could claim to hold experiential knowledge, as policy-makers increasingly sought out the experiences of patients and service-users in the late twentieth century.29 At the same time, PAIN influenced policy-makers through traditional channels—writing to Members of Parliament, contributing to public inquiries, and speaking to the media. In doing so, PAIN played a role in bringing the parental perspective into social policy, changing the balance of rights and responsibilities between parents and children. Third, I will question the extent to which PAIN could effectively represent the ‘experiences’ of all falsely accused parents. The limited evidence available suggests that PAIN spoke primarily for middle-class parents, and PAIN certainly emphasized a representation of their membership as ‘respectable’ two-parent, mother-oriented families. Whilst Hilton et al have highlighted the significance of professionalization in guiding the post-war voluntary sector, I will assert that experiential knowledge has also been significant, and that these two, apparently distinct, forms of knowledge have in fact been combined and entwined within small voluntary organizations.

PAIN and Parents
PAIN worked effectively with falsely accused parents because the Amphletts themselves had had personal experience of the child protection system, as had many of PAIN’s other staff and volunteers. In their support work, PAIN sought to enable parents to communicate with one another, a project which assumed the value of shared experience. To facilitate these support networks, PAIN instated formal structures of management and organization, reflecting the broader ‘professionalization’ of the voluntary sector. Thus, parents came to PAIN because of the Amphletts’ personal experiences but, at the same time, relied upon PAIN’s expertise in establishing channels for contact, gaining funding, and communicating with solicitors, physicians and social workers.

When describing their reasons for establishing PAIN, the Amphletts focused heavily on their personal history. One undated pamphlet, simply labelled ‘Publicity Material’, told the Amphletts’ story as follows: Between October 1983 and February 1984 the Amphletts’ youngest daughter sustained two fractures on her right arm.30 After her second fracture, the Amphletts took her to an accident and emergency ward. There, they were referred to social services. A family case conference was held to establish whether the children were safe living in their home. The Amphletts’ daughters were not taken into care, but the children were placed on the Child Abuse Register, a list of children considered at risk of abuse, and Susan was cautioned by police officers.31 Nine months after this case conference, following sustained monitoring by social services, the Amphlett children were removed from the Child Abuse Register, but shortly afterwards the youngest daughter sustained another fracture.32 On seeking further medical advice, Susan and Steve found that she had brittle bone disease, explaining why she had always sustained fractures after relatively minor falls.33 Susan and Steve stated of their experiences that: ‘[we were] appalled by the manner in which we have been treated’, and particularly by the fact that they were not allowed to attend the case conference convened to discuss their daughter.34 Hoping to help other parents who had been falsely accused of child abuse, the Amphletts founded PAIN. Steve and Susan’s account was thus confessional, as the Amphletts explained that, like other parents, they too had been accused of fundamentally transgressing social norms, and abusing their children. Their account was also inspirational, as the Amphletts explained how they had proven their innocence, and not lost custody of their children. By placing their experiences at the forefront of their campaigning literature, the Amphletts could reassure other falsely accused parents that they understood their experiences and could provide support.

Steve was an engineer by trade, and Susan a nurse, which were not professions directly equipping them to organize a voluntary group. Nonetheless, Susan became PAIN’s Director, whilst Steve continued to work as an engineer and to help with PAIN in the evenings and at weekends. PAIN’s work was primarily carried out from a small office in the Amphletts’ home in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire.35 Alongside Susan, the office was staffed by between one and three secretaries, at various points, and in PAIN’s newsletter of August 1988, a temporary secretary Liza described their home as: ‘A semi-detached bungalow in the middle of nowhere, under the flight path to Stanstead [sic] airport … The dining table was covered with heaps of paper with a large typewriter half buried in the middle. . . Boxes of papers created an obstacle course across the floor’.36 She wrote that temps ‘get jobs in odd places … but this was the most unusual’.37 Thus, the article continued, to work in such a site: ‘These people were obviously dedicated to the work of the charity’.38 A contribution to the August 1988 newsletter by PAIN’s secretary Noelene similarly emphasized the dedication of the Amphletts, stating that ‘I have not just joined a Charity but a Family … a very loving and caring family’.39 The Amphletts allowed the support work of PAIN to pervade their home and free-time, and to redirect Sue’s career.

Throughout its lifespan, PAIN conducted support work with numerous parents. PAIN took parents’ protestations of innocence at face value, because of their recognition that innocence was sometimes difficult to prove, and their belief that many parents were being falsely accused.40 PAIN’s willingness to represent any parent was occasionally, though not regularly, challenged. The Guardian journalists Victor Smart and James Erlichman suggested that PAIN could be utilized to ‘provide respectable cover for child molesters’ in 1987 and 1997—demonstrating that complaints about the groups’ legitimacy were continuing throughout its lifespan.41 Nonetheless, between July 1986 and December 1987 PAIN had advised over 1,000 families, and had conducted sustained case work with 500 of these. In 1998, Susan Amphlett wrote that the organization advised and supported approximately 900 new families annually, and remained involved in a further 2,500 ongoing cases.42 Susan Amphlett wrote in PAIN’s July 1987 newsletter that ‘the time spent on each history obviously varied’ between 11 and 70 hours, and would involve phone calls to support the parents, phone calls to explain, mediate and facilitate the relationship between the parents and their solicitor, doctors and psychiatrists, home visits on some occasions, and the production and maintenance of PAIN’s records.43

To carry out this kind of case work, the Amphletts developed in-depth technical knowledge of the child protection system. PAIN offered professional expertise in a supportive and understanding manner, identifying and working with individual professionals who were sympathetic to their cause. For example, PAIN put many families in touch with Dr. Colin Patterson, a physician who invented the controversial category of Temporary Brittle Bone Disease, and between 1975 and 1987 intervened in fifty child protection cases to diagnose the disease.44 The workers at PAIN had acquired high levels of professional knowledge but, due to their limited staff-base, PAIN struggled to maintain their case load. In the newsletter of July 1987 Amphlett apologized ‘for the delay some of you may be experiencing in getting assistance from us’.45

PAIN was also able to establish regional branches, to ease the workload of the Headquarters.46 The first branches were established in Leeds, Oldham, Blackburn and Wales.47 In subsequent years, branches were founded in London, the East of England, the South and South West, the North of England, Scotland, the Midland region and the North East.48 The services which each branch provided varied, dependent on the availability of the ‘Regional Administrators’, but all offered telephone and letter-writing support, and some established support groups for local parents.49 Referencing a new support group in the August 1989 newsletter, the Administrator for the East of England wrote that ‘These families have a lot in common and have been in contact and found each other very supportive’.50 PAIN gave some funding to their regional centres—£6,570 in the financial year ending 1989—but Administrators were also expected to raise their own income to cover their telephone and postage bills.51

The majority of Regional Administrators came to the role having themselves been helped by PAIN. Alison Stevens, for example, was a long-serving Regional Administrator for Leicestershire, working for PAIN from 1986 until 1999. Stevens was falsely accused of abusing her 3-year-old son in 1985, and a Leicester Mercury profile of 2005 stated that after recovering her child ‘Alison decided to use her experience to help other parents in a similar situation’ and also quoted Stevens’ assertion that ‘I was quite lucky to have someone to help me and now it helps me help others—they get to talk to someone who understands and has been through it’.52 However, not all Administrators had themselves been falsely accused of abuse: the representative for the Midlands Region wrote in PAIN’s 1989 newsletter that she was ’an ordinary mother’ but as a children’s nurse had ‘grown more concerned about the way children can so easily (it appears to me) be removed from their home on POSO [Place of Safety Order]’.53 Administrators were thus always passionate about PAIN’s cause, but had been brought to PAIN by different experiences.

Seeking to disseminate her knowledge, Susan Amphlett trained the Administrators herself, providing advice on counselling, fundraising and publicity.54 Administrators described the training as ‘intensive, rigorous yet enjoyable’ and leaving them ‘“shell-shocked” in more ways than one!’55 Indeed, the Administrator role was difficult and time-consuming, and Administrators often wrote to PAIN’s newsletter to apologize for being temporarily unable to receive telephone calls or to ‘remember your name or the details of your particular case’.56 Administrators also described their work as emotionally draining, with one writing that ‘I wonder if the phrase “fools step in where angels fear to tread” is a good description of me these days!’ and another that ‘I feel your hurt, anger and despair’.57 Administrators sought to find local representatives within their regions, but were not always successful, and there was a high turnover within this role.58

PAIN thus was built on experience on both a national and a regional level but, at the same time, needed to act professionally in order to handle its heavy case-load. The entwinement of professional and experiential knowledge may be seen in the composition of PAIN’s Board of Trustees, which was composed of between four and nine Trustees, and met forty times between 1985 and 1998.59 Throughout PAIN’s existence, Trustees were a mix of Regional Administrators, parental activists, and representatives from medicine, social work, and the law.60 PAIN’s funding, also, was drawn from both professional bodies and also from supportive parents. In 1987, 92 per cent of PAIN’s £4,428 funding was drawn from its supporters and the public, and the remaining 8 per cent generated from loans, interest on the deposit account and cash already in hand.61 After PAIN registered as a charity in 1987 the organization also began to receive grants from the government and charitable Trusts. In the financial year ending 1989, for example, PAIN gained grants from the Department of Health (£18,000), the Mental Health Foundation (£10,000), Telethon Trusts (£5,500), The Fairway Trust (£5,000), The Hilden Trust (£1,000), the Charles French Trust (£200), the Edward Cadbury Trust (£1,000), the Noel Buxton Trust (£1,000), and the Courtald Trust (£500). Until 1996 the government continued to provide PAIN with annual grants of between £10,000 and £35,000.62

PAIN also continued to gain funding from a loyal support-base of involved parents. PAIN gained money from their membership fee—a £10 annual charge—and from fund-raising activities organized by members, including marathon running in Bolton and a Fair Day in Newcastle on Tyne.63 Parental fundraising raised relatively substantial sums: £7,169 in the financial year ending 1988, and £8,528 in 1989. Still, newsletters emphasized that the group was in ‘desperate need’ of more funding, and stated that: ‘we really have achieved an incredible amount on a very small sum of money. Imagine how much more effective we could be in [sic] we had reasonable funding’.64

Susan Amphlett described PAIN as a ‘self-help organisation’ in the group’s first newsletter.65 Providing a preface to this newsletter, the social work academic Nigel Parton wrote that PAIN ‘is not a professional group with its own professional interests to advance. It is a group of parents who have come together primarily because of similar experiences. The role of providing mutual support and advice is vital. There are very few places people can go to for this’.66 PAIN was not only a self-help group, but created formal structures such as a Board of Trustees and patrons, as well as compiling audited accounts, training their Administrators, and employing some full-time staff. Nonetheless, PAIN’s publicity materials regularly reiterated that the organization had been formed because of personal experience, and PAIN did seek to create structures through which falsely accused parents could help one another, particularly through the phone line, support groups, and the system of Regional Administrators. PAIN was able to work effectively with parents because it utilized and emphasized experiential knowledge. In working with parents, however, the leaders of PAIN mediated between parents and solicitors and physicians and social workers, and themselves became ‘experts’ in this area, their own knowledge-base stretching beyond personal experience alone.

PAIN in Policy
PAIN also mediated between falsely accused parents and policy-makers, seeking to bring the experiences of parents into the construction of policy. PAIN offered case studies to newspapers and public inquiries, and encouraged parents to write directly to their Members of Parliament. PAIN was, to an extent, working within the political system and bringing experience into policy through the mainstream channels but, at the same time, was also very critical of the state in many of its statements to newspapers and parents.

PAIN provided case studies to left-wing, right-wing, tabloid and broadsheet newspapers, which were reproduced by journalists including David Brindle from the Guardian and Anthea Gerrie from the Daily Mail.67 PAIN also gave a series of case studies to the Inquiries around the cases in Cleveland, Rochdale and Orkney, and also submitted a response to Child Abuse—Working Together, A Draft Guide to the Arrangement for Inter-Agency Co-operation For the Protection of Children, a booklet produced by the Department of Health and Social Security in 1986.68 The case studies provided were usually concise, and explained the situation of the family, their background, the child protection intervention, and the course of action which was eventually taken. A case study published in the Daily Mail in June 1987 was as follows:
ENGINEER Peter (not his real name) and his wife Paula had taken their five-year-old mentally retarded son to hospital for a general consultation, when the shocking diagnosis came back of sexual abuse by the child’s father.

The little girl was not allowed home but spent her sixth birthday and Christmas in the hospital before being transferred to a children’s home. It took three nightmarish months before independent assessments, asked for not only by the parents but also by the court, proved that the diagnosis was totally without foundation. This hospital consultant had made the diagnosis following a secret session with the child in which he asked her to play with ‘anatomically correct’ dolls.69


This case study represents several themes common to those offered by PAIN. First, the idea that parents had openly taken their child to a physician.70 PAIN’s fifty-page response to Child Abuse—Working Together, similarly, stated that ‘Our parent members are the type of people who use the services available such as clinic, health centres and casualties ... Their babies and children are taken regularly to be weighed and examined and are up to date with their vaccinations’. PAIN’s members were the ‘type of people’ who diligently utilized state-provided education, health and welfare, a representation which chimed with the contemporary work of Michel Foucault around how the experts and agents of ‘the state’ observed, governed and disciplined families along lines of ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ conduct.71

Second, case studies often emphasized the devastation of parents caught up in this ‘hellish’ or ‘nightmarish’ situation.72 Parents utilized highly emotional language, describing their ‘anguish, anxiety, shame, helplessness’, ‘fear’, ‘anger’, ‘disbelief’, ‘despair’, ‘horror’, ‘terror’, ‘helplessness’ and ‘sheer desperation’.73 The organization’s acronym, PAIN, also emphasized the emotions felt by falsely accused parents.74 The emotional language underlined the distress for dedicated parents who were unable to perform the ‘normal’ activities of familial life, such as tucking their children into bed, reading bedtime stories and being present for birthdays.75 Third, case studies tended to revolve around relatively clear-cut cases.76 The Mail’s case was shown to be ‘totally without foundation’, and other cases found children who had been proven to have brittle bone disease, or where medical practitioners had mixed up slides or diagnoses.77 Thus, PAIN was emphasizing the cases where parents’ innocence was conclusively proven.

PAIN sought to emphasize that each of these case studies were not isolated incidents, but rather the ‘tip of the iceberg’ under which a mass of families were being wrongfully accused of child abuse. The organization often offered statistics to support this assertion, for example in telling the Guardian that six out of seven of the 160,000 children annually subjected to child abuse investigations had not been abused, and were not ultimately placed on the child abuse register.78 With the evidence of case studies and statistics, PAIN then made policy suggestions, calling for the creation of a complaints procedure for parents, the improved collection of statistics around the incidence of child abuse, and a guarantee that parents would have the right to be assessed with their children in their own homes, and to gain a secondary medical opinion.79

PAIN thus mediated parental experiences by choosing case studies, and drawing particular lessons from them. PAIN was able to bring these collated experiences to the media and public inquiries because of their professional expertise, which enabled them to build relationships with specific journalists and policy-makers, and to write persuasively. Indeed, in her statement to the Cleveland Inquiry, Susan Amphlett opened by asserting that: ‘I am a fully qualified State Registered Nurse and hold a Part I Central Mid-Wives Board, Post Registration Course in Occupational Health Nursing Certificate with Distinction’.80 When talking to policy-makers, Amphlett emphasized her traditional forms of expertise. With this in mind, she continued: ‘As a result of my own experience … I have become concerned’, before outlining several case studies and conclusions.81

As well as collating and representing parents’ experiences, PAIN also encouraged its parents to write directly to Members of Parliament. Amphlett wrote in PAIN’s first newsletter that ‘We must inform our MPs of what is happening and we must complain to our local councillors. We must complain in writing, to Directors of Social Services and we encourage you to use your stories to illustrate bad practices whenever possible’.82 Janet Ali, one of PAIN’s Trustees, also advised in the August 1988 newsletter to ‘write to local MPs and particularly local Councillors’. From her experiences as a solicitor, Ali noted that these actors ‘can be very helpful. Directors of Social Services usually take note of complaints by the local Councillors and MPs’.83 The circulation of PAIN’s newsletter was 1,200 in 1988, although there is no way to trace how many parents took up this call.84 Nonetheless, it is significant that PAIN believed in the ability of ‘stories’ to ‘illustrate’ bad practice, and to inform change, and this pays testament to the confidence of the voluntary sector in the significance of experiential knowledge in the late twentieth century.85

Whilst PAIN sought to work with policy-makers to inform change, the organization was also, sometimes, highly critical of the state. In a pamphlet from 1986, provided to parents, PAIN suggested that ‘the authorities’ acted to trick innocent parents into confessing their guilt with threats and coercion. A section entitled ‘Things the Authorities Say’ included ‘If you try to get your husband out on bail you will never see your baby again’, ‘If you admit to hurting your baby you will get him back sooner’ and ‘Even if you haven’t done it, it would be better if you say you have’.86 PAIN was also very critical of state power when speaking to the media. Amphlett claimed that the state should not be a parent, taking children into care to raise itself, and leaving ‘real’ parents’ ‘powerless and helpless’, a potent idea amidst the growing awareness of institutional abuse in the 1990s.87 Drawing on the Thatcherite notion that the economic extension of the state was related to moral decline, Amphlett asked: ‘What damage are we doing to the structure of our society? What damage are we doing to family life?’88 In 2000, Amphlett drew on the language of empowerment, telling the Guardian that: ‘The system is like a huge juggernaut which rides over whatever you try to do. It is very alien to most parents and leaves them feeling disempowered’.89

Whilst PAIN sought to criticize child protection, its arguments were taken to denounce the overextension of all state power, and in 1996 PAIN was described in the Guardian and the Observer newspapers as ‘an organisation which is trying to curb the excesses of state interference’ and ‘an organisation which fights state excesses and which actually knows the state does harm’.90 The Daily Mail also utilized the case study of PAIN to make a broader critique. In a 1987 article entitled ‘How can they call this “care”?’, Gerrie wrote:
Like the Pol Pot regime of Cambodia, we have become chillingly adept at separating children rapidly from their parents and placing them under State rule, through the official powers we have awarded ourselves. There is nothing to equal the harm done to children by sex abuse, but it is our concern with this that perhaps blinds us to the awful cruelty that the State can inflict upon innocent children.91


Dramatically, Gerrie utilized case studies offered by PAIN to suggest that the British state was as overextended as the tyrannical regime of Pol Pot. To an extent, by criticizing ‘the state’, PAIN was echoing the language and experiences of individual parents, and contemporary social surveys found that parents who had encountered child protection services often tended to perceive all state workers in child protection as the same, generic ‘professionals’ who talked down to parents with a ‘we know best’ attitude.92

Thus, PAIN sought to bring parents’ experiences into policy through traditional channels and also through more radical critique, and PAIN sometimes reflected the way in which some parents criticized ‘the state’ and professionals, and sometimes encouraged parents themselves to contact their Members of Parliament and to work within ‘the system’. The extent to which PAIN was successful in bringing the experiences of falsely accused parents in to policy is difficult to ascertain. Certainly, the Children Act of 1989 stated that it was ‘a charter for children’ but, at the same time, that: ‘Central to the philosophy of the Act is the belief that children are best looked after within the family with both parents playing a full part and without resort to legal proceedings’.93 In terms of child protection, the Act replaced Place of Safety Orders with Emergency Protection Orders (EPOs). Both were mechanisms through which social workers could remove children from their parents or guardians. However, parents could not challenge POSOs for 28 days, whereas EPOs could only last for 8 days (unless extended by the court for an additional week), and parents could challenge these orders after just 72 hours.94 The Act also mandated that authorities would ‘seek the views’ of parents when child protection cases were being reviewed, and would also ‘notify details of the result of the review and of any decision taken by them’.95 Local authorities now had to establish a procedure to allow parents to complain, and to ensure that at least one person who was not a member of the authority took part in case reviews.96

PAIN was not satisfied by the changes made to policy. On the organization’s closure in 1999, representatives of PAIN wrote to the Guardian to bemoan that ‘things had not improved’ since the groups’ foundation in 1986.97 In 2009 Trevor Jones, on behalf of the reconstituted PAIN, told a public inquiry that the organization had seen ‘very little change for the better’ and was still ‘advising and advocating on the same issues’.98 Jones reiterated this conclusion when providing written evidence to the House of Commons Education Committee in 2012.99 We must not overstate the extent to which parents have been incorporated into the child protection intervention since the 1980s. Nonetheless, it is significant that policy-makers have sought to include parents, and also to pay testament to the need to hear parents’ voices in both the policy-making process and the implementation of child protection work. Notably, the Conservative Party manifesto of 1997 echoed the arguments and rhetoric of PAIN in stating that: ‘A heavy-handed and intrusive state can do enormous damage … When the state goes too far, it is often the children who suffer’.100

The ideas espoused by PAIN thus became influential in later years. Some contemporary commentators suggested that PAIN had influenced this shift, by bringing the experiences of parents to the attention of policy-makers. A practitioners guide from 1991, The Child Protection Handbook, stated that PAIN was ‘influential in ensuring that the rights of parents and of children to be left at home, free of state intervention and removal, were placed on the political and professional agendas’.101 On PAIN’s closure, Chris Davies, the President of the Association of Directors of Social Services, reflected that the existence of PAIN had shown that social services must find ‘ways of parents having an input’.102 In 2000, the Chairman of this Association’s Children and Families Committee, Rob Hutchinson, also stated that PAIN was ‘very challenging to us’ and ‘helped maintain a balance as parents’ advocates in the hugely difficult area of child protection’.103

At the same time, many other factors were at play: contemporary policy researchers simultaneously argued that parents should have more of a say in child protection, the local authority of the London Borough of Sutton was experimenting with this approach, and prominent public inquiries reached similar conclusions.104 The theorist of social work Ray Jones has argued that the Children’s Acts produced between 1948 until 2008 were driven by both policy research and changes in practice.105 However, Jones does not also recognize the significance of campaign groups. Furthermore, changes in policy research, practice and the voluntary sector were entwined with one another as particular individuals worked between and within each of these fields. The critique which PAIN made through the media was viewed by social workers, policy-makers, and other charities, some of whom directly responded to PAIN in the letter pages of newspapers.106 PAIN drew lessons from and advised the Cleveland Parents Support Group, who in turn provided evidence to the Butler-Sloss inquiry. Mr David Monk, the Area Manager of Sutton Social Services, became a Trustee of PAIN in 1988, as did Reverend Michael Wright, who organized the group at Cleveland.107 Groups such as PAIN brought experiential knowledge into policy, and to the attention of social workers, physicians and public.

The Limits of ‘Experience’
PAIN thus mediated between falsely accused parents, policy-makers, solicitors, physicians and social workers. PAIN was able to work with each of these groups because the organization sought to represent personal experience in a professional manner. But did PAIN represent the experiences of all falsely accused parents? I will demonstrate that the evidence available suggests that the majority of PAIN’s membership were middle class. Furthermore, I will argue that PAIN worked hard to actively represent their membership as ‘respectable’; articulate, affluent, and mother-oriented families. By propagating this representation, PAIN drew on broader anxieties about the state of the family, and argued that its members were not the ‘type of people’ who would abuse their children. Whilst this presentation reflected prevailing social concerns, it also placed clear limitations on the ability of the group to represent all falsely accused parents.

It is impossible to know the demographics of the families who PAIN worked with, as their case files were destroyed. It is likely that the families involved in PAIN were what may be characterized as ‘middle class’. In a study conducted during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the sociologist Jon Prosser visited the homes of thirty parents falsely accused of abuse and represented by PAIN. Prosser stated that ‘middle class parents’ embroiled in child protection interventions were more likely than their ‘working class counterparts’ to obtain a lawyer earlier, be assertive, and to construct substantial defence mechanisms.108 Prosser stated that working class families, by contrast, and particularly those receiving state benefits, took a more submissive role, accepted the decisions made by Social Services, and did not seek out a solicitor or a second medical opinion.109 Prosser did not explain what indicators he took to represent a ‘middle class’ and a ‘working class’ parent. It seems likely that the parents who Prosser deemed ‘middle class’, who, he stated, were more likely to challenge child protection proceedings, were also more likely to join PAIN. Certainly, Prosser only described one of the families who he visited as ‘working class’.110 This chimes with the findings of numerous historians and sociologists that the membership of New Social Movements and non-governmental organizations was usually dominated by the middle classes.111

Certainly, the case studies which PAIN offered to media, researchers and policy-makers presented a very specific model of the family. I would contend that PAIN sought to represent the ‘respectable family’. Notions of respectability have long been ill-defined, yet tied to ideas around status and morality.112 PAIN families had lost ‘respectability’ because they had been accused of fundamentally transgressing their parental roles, and abusing their children. PAIN sought to reassert the status of these families as ‘respectable’. The case studies offered by PAIN to media and researchers presented families who worked in respected professions, such as law, medicine, and teaching.113 The families could afford good solicitors, had never been involved with the police before, and meticulously collected and retained the documents related to their cases.114 Prosser described PAIN parents’ homes as ‘well furnished’, ‘comfortable and attractive’, ‘clean and tidy’, and ‘extremely well renovated’, and as located within ‘pleasant’ neighbourhoods or ‘just outside a rural village’. These descriptions held much in common with F.M.L. Thompson’s Victorian ‘respectable working-class homes’.115

The presentation of PAIN members as respectable was promoted in the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) documentary Open Space: Innocents at Risk. Aired on 17 March 1986, Innocents at Risk was a half-hour documentary produced by the Community Programming Unit which, between 1972 and 2004, commissioned programmes ‘proposed by people with opinions that are under-represented on television’.116
Innocents at Risk was made in collaboration between a Director and a Producer from the BBC, Stephanie Cartwright and Gavin Dutton, and PAIN. Television programmes reach an indefinite range of potential recipients, presenting a one-directional form of communication.117 The historian Joe Moran has written that the 1970s and 1980s were an ‘age of one-nation television’ as ‘the same programmes were watched and loved by huge and diverse audiences’.118 Creating Innocents at Risk thus gave PAIN the opportunity to disseminate their key messages to the British public.

The programme featured interviews with the Amphletts and three other families represented by PAIN. The programme opened by portraying a well made up woman wearing a formal dress and standing in a pleasant and well-furnished home. The woman is gazing into a large mirror as she carefully puts on expensive-looking earrings. A man appears, dressed in a smart suit. The man carefully puts on a tie, using the same mirror. The narrator tells us that this is Darren and Helen, a married couple whose baby was taken into care at 6 weeks old under allegations of physical abuse. The parents are preparing to make a court appearance seeking the return of their daughter. The careful positioning of the earrings and the tie provide as a visual signifier of the affluence of the family, and the seriousness and respect with which the family treats a court appearance. The parents’ gestures mirror one another, and they are both reflected in the mirror, accentuating the synchronicity of their lives and their shared determination to seek the return of their daughter. Susan Amphlett told the documentary viewers that, for this type of parent, being placed on the child abuse register put: ‘a wedge through your family life’. PAIN members found the challenge to whether you’re ‘bringing up your family in a responsible way’ ‘beyond words’ and ‘simply not tolerable’.119 Through visual message, case study and word, the documentary portrayed a respectable type of parent who would not abuse their children.

Thompson and the sociologist Beverely Skeggs have demonstrated that ideas of respectability have contained clear judgements about gender.120 Indeed, Susan Amphlett told the documentary that being involved in child protection investigations made her ‘begin to doubt my capabilities as a mother’.121 Helen also emphasized that she felt ‘broken down’ when her child was taken away.122 While her daughter was in care Helen felt that their mother–child bond was being eroded, as was physically denoted when Helen could no longer breastfeed her.123 Helen was devastated to lose her mothering role, stating that: ‘as far as she was concerned I was just another person, I wasn’t her mother, theoretically the foster mum was her mother, she did everything for her that a mother should do’.124 The documentary reveals that Darren and Helen’s child was returned to them by the court. In a subsequent interview Helen expresses joy at having regained not only her child but also her role as a mother. The interviewer asks Helen ‘How are you feeling?’ Helen responds that she is feeling ‘Brilliant … I’m a Mum again’.125 Helen’s emotional state is explicitly linked to her ability to perform her role as a mother. Whilst Helen’s testimony to the Innocents at Risk documentary is long, detailed, and emotive, her husband Darren is less prominently featured. More broadly, in a report to the Department of Health and Social Security in 1986, PAIN wrote that when placed on the child abuse register, many mothers who were working gave up their jobs ‘for fear that if they carried on working they would be seen as uncaring’.126 It is also notable that Susan Amphlett gave up her job as a nurse to organize PAIN, whilst Steven Amphlett did not.

Innocents at Risk was viewed by 1.4 million viewers, the largest audience Open Space had had.127 To these viewers, PAIN presented a very specific model of the family, which reflected broader social and political anxieties about the family, parenting and particularly motherhood. The construction of PAIN’s respectable families spoke to the concerns of New Right figures and moral crusaders that ‘traditional’ or ‘golden age’ families were being destroyed by rising rates of divorce, illegitimacy and single parenthood, as well as global Fordism, large-scale immigration, and the appearance of ‘problem families’.128 PAIN’s focus on the mother as the central figure has a long history, but was also a reflection of psychoanalytic research around ‘attachment theory’ and the importance of maternal love for child development, influential in contemporary parenting manuals and thought, as well as new concerns around the expanding employment of women and emergence of second-wave feminism.129 Whilst representing a difficult cause, PAIN sought to benefit from prevalent—if not necessarily well-founded—concerns about the state of the family.

It is unlikely that PAIN’s portrayal of the respectable family represented the experiences of all families who were falsely accused of child abuse. Indeed, other voluntary groups emerged seeking to support and help different ‘types of parents’. The Five Percenters sought to unite, support and consolidate a knowledge-base for parents who were falsely accused of shaking their babies. The groups’ name referenced the belief that one shaken baby case in twenty was misdiagnosed.130 Regional groups also, such as those established in Leeds, Cleveland, Orkney and Rochdale, enabled parents from the same locale to meet physically, and to support one another more easily, as well as to exchange specific information about the issues in their region.131 The lack of attention paid to fathers facilitated the emergence of fathers rights groups, such as Families Need Fathers (1974), Dads Against Discrimination (2002), Even Toddlers Need Fathers (2003) and Fathers 4 Justice (2002). In 1999, the group Falsely Accused Carers and Teachers emerged seeking to support falsely accused teachers, social workers and physicians.132 Parents groups have also emerged in new areas since the late 1990s and early 2000s, reflecting new concerns such as campaigns around vaccinations and autism.133

Since the closure of the initial PAIN in 1999, similar groups have not emerged, even though parents continue to be falsely accused of child abuse. It is difficult to understand how to interpret this. Some falsely accused parents are still represented by the new PAIN, although this is a far smaller organization. Why do falsely accused parents no longer unite, mobilize and campaign? With an increasingly tense climate around child protection issues, and attention shifting towards helping survivors, perhaps parents are now less willing to publicly announce that they have been accused of abuse. As I outlined, policy has also shifted towards further including parents in child protection, so perhaps to an extent falsely accused parents feel less need to engage in activism, and are looking for solutions within ‘the system’. It is possible that falsely accused parents are still united, but online within chat rooms, and via email, with new and private technologies which are not visible to the historian. On the other hand, perhaps the barriers to activism appear higher to falsely accused parents, amidst the professionalization and competitiveness of the voluntary sector.

The landscape of activism has thus changed in response to shifting social and moral concerns, as well as to reflect the existing foci of the voluntary sector and policy, and the shape of PAIN’s campaigning speaks to anxieties around the family, parent and the child in 1980s and 1990s Britain. PAIN was a product not only of the experiences of the Amphletts, but also of a historical period imbued with anxieties around family life. Like any voluntary group, PAIN could not represent everyone, despite relying on experience to work effectively with parents and policy-makers. Nonetheless, the group did work with a substantial number of parents, who understood and lived their experiences through the mediation and publications of this group.

Conclusion
The history of late-twentieth-century Britain remains incomplete without attention to the small voluntary groups who acted as ‘buffers’ between new identity-constituencies and traditional sources of ‘expertise’ such as physicians, social workers, solicitors, and policy-makers. These groups have emerged and multiplied in the field of child protection since the 1970s. Alongside PAIN, groups have also emerged to support, represent and empower adults who were abused as children, including national groups such as the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, One in Four UK and Phoenix Survivors, and also regional groups including Survivors Swindon, Survivors Helping Each Other, Nottinghamshire, and Norfolk’s Surviving Together. Buffer groups emerge because child protection and child abuse are serious, important and emotive issues which straddle institutions related to health, crime and welfare. Many other issues—such as drug use, sexuality, juvenile crime and homelessness—also straddle such areas, however, and it is likely that small groups have emerged to act as buffers in these areas too.

These groups are not without precedent—since the sixteenth-century fraternities and religious guilds have provided space for mutual aid and self-help, traditions continued into the nineteenth century by Friendly Societies and the Co-operative Movement, and in the twentieth century by trade unionism.134 Whilst PAIN had historical precedents, much of its activism was characteristic of the post-war period. Parents were able to communicate with one another utilizing developing forms of communication technology, particularly the telephone line, also adopted in the post-war period by the Samaritans (since 1953), Britain’s Gay Switchboard (founded 1974), and ChildLine (1986).135 Parents shared their emotions with this broader collective—telling deeply personal stories within the organization’s newsletters, and in newspaper interviews and through a television documentary, which supports the assertions of Deborah Cohen and Adrian Bingham that the post-war period saw a broader ‘confessional culture’, whereby adults increasingly described and revealed experiences which would have previously been kept secret. Cohen and Bingham point towards agony aunt columns, newspaper reporting, and the boom in counselling, psychiatry and psychoanalysis, but voluntary groupings were also formed around new issues of identity.136 Indeed, ‘identity politics’ developed and extended in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, amidst a shift from material to life and identity concerns. New social issues—such as child abuse—brought new identities, such as the falsely accused parent.

In the post-war period, the state has expanded and extended to new forms of intervention in education, welfare and health. The campaigning of PAIN points towards the broader and concurrent idea that representatives of the public should be able to contribute to policy-construction, seen in literatures around how patients and ‘service users’ were reconfigured from ‘passive’ to ‘active’ recipients of welfare in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.137 This trend has continued in child protection, in rhetoric if not in reality, as may be seen by Home Secretary Theresa May’s determination to gain the ‘confidence of survivors’ who must have a ‘strong voice’ and be ‘at the heart’ of the Independent Inquiry into Child Abuse, first established in July 2014 in order to ‘consider whether public bodies—and other, non-state, institutions—have taken seriously their duty of care to protect children from sexual abuse’.138

PAIN was able to work with parents because the Amphletts had personal experience of being falsely accused, and also gained professional experience in working on child protection cases. PAIN was able to work with policy-makers because the group collated and brought personal experiences to bear on political issues, through the traditional routes of letter-writing and contributing to inquiries, and also through the media. PAIN thus combined the passion and identity-claims of New Social Movements and service-user organizations, and the technocratic expertise of non-governmental organizations. The existence and relative successes of PAIN suggest that experiential and professional knowledge were entwined in the politics of the late twentieth century. PAIN was a very small group, but nonetheless acted as a buffer within the intermediary terrain between public and expert, negotiating and shaping ideas of parenting, family, childhood, respectability and the state.

Promoters play fundamental roles in successful transformation and gene expression. Fragments of the upstream regulatory region of the movement protein gene of the Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV; two fragments) and Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus (WmCSV, two fragments) and one fragment of the coat protein putative promoter of TYLCV (CPTY-pro) were isolated to assess their abilities to drive expression in monocot and dicot plants. We used bioinformatic analyses to identify tentative motifs in the fragments. The five promoter fragments were isolated, fused with the GUS reporter gene, and transformed into tomato, watermelon, and rice plantlets via Agrobacterium infiltration. GUS expression driven by each putative promoter was analysed using histochemical and fluorometric analyses. In both dicots and the monocots, the highest level of GUS expression was obtained using a truncated regulatory region from TYLCV (MMPTY-pro) followed by a truncated regulatory region from WmCSV (MMPWm-pro). However, the corresponding full-length fragments from TYLCV and WmCSV showed essentially equivalent expression levels in the fluorometric GUS assay compared with the enhanced Cauliflower mosaic virus e35S-pro. In addition, CPTY-pro showed no expression in either the dicots or the monocot. This study demonstrated that MMPTY-pro and MMPWm-pro may be useful as plant promoters.

Introduction
In the last decades agriculture was considered to be biological machinery. With accumulative information of genetics, plant breeders have enhanced crop quality and yield. In this century recombinant DNA technology facilitated the characterization and isolation of valuable genes that can be introduced into living organisms to obtain new traits with improved qualities.

Gene expression levels and patterns depend on the presence or absence of cis-regulatory elements in their promoter regions. Expression can be monitored experimentally using a reporter gene under control of the putative promoter. Promoters can be constitutive, inducible, or tissue-specific. Some geminivirus promoters are able to drive constitutive gene expression in transgenic plants, while others are subject to regulation. For example, the CP promoter from Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) is active in both phloem and mesophyll cells in the presence of a transcriptional activator protein (TrAP).

Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a member of the genus Begomovirus in the family Geminiviridae (Briddon et al. 1996). Its monopartite single-stranded genome encodes five proteins from both the virion (V) and complementary (C) strands: C1, C2, C3, V1, and V2. V1 and V2 are late-expression genes that code for the viral pre-coat and coat (CP) proteins, respectively; V2 expression is transactivated by the C2 protein. C1, or REP, is a replication protein that recognizes the origin sequence (ori) in the viral genome (Laufs et al. 1995). C1 can positively regulate expression by binding to the viral replication enhancer protein, C3 (Settlage et al. 1996; Castillo et al. 2003). C2 is involved in CP expression regulation (Dry et al. 2000) and plays a role in viral systemic spread in plants.

The last open reading frame in the group of early-expression genes is c4-ORF, which encodes a movement protein (MP) that is responsible for viral movement from cell to cell through plasmodesmata. We previously reported that gene was highly expressed (Abu El-Heba et al. 1999), so we decided to isolate and evaluate the expression efficiency of its promoter and compare it with another geminivirus MP promoter and the widely used Cauliflower mosaic virus e35S promoter as a control.

We chose to isolate the MP promoter from the Watermelon chlorotic stunt virus (WmCSV), a bipartite geminivirus (Lecoq et al. 1994; Dafalla et al. 1998; Kheyr-Pour et al. 2000). Segment A of its genome contains the same genes as the TYLCV genome, except the MP BC1, which is incorporated within intergenic region of segment B (Orozco and Hanley-Bowdoin 1996).

In this study, the putative MP promoters of TYLCV (MP-TYLCV) and WmCSV (MP-WmCSV) were tested for their effects on the expression of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. Agrobacterium infiltration was used to transform dicot and monocot plants with a promoter–GUS construct to monitor promoter activity. Both promoters showed great promise for recombinant protein production.

Materials and methods
Plant material
To study the isolated promoter fragments, watermelon (Citrulluslanatus; Cucurbitaceae) cv. Giza1 and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum; Solanaceae) cv. CastleRock were used as model dicots, while rice (Oryza sativa; Poaceae) cv. Swat II was used as a monocot model. 5-day-old hypocotyledonous discs of watermelon and tomato were cultured as explants on MS medium (Murashige and Skoog 1962)
supplemented with 1 mg/L 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), 0.25 abscisic acid and 5 mg/L AgNO3. Rice callus was initiated from seeds on MS medium containing 2 mg/L of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid for 1 month.

Culture incubation conditions
All regeneration experiments were conducted in MS medium containing 30 g/L sucrose and 8.0 g/L agar, with a pH of 5.8 before autoclaving. All plant cultures were maintained in a growth chamber at 25 °C ± 2 under fluorescent lights (8/16 h dark/light).

Cloning the putative TYLCV and WmCSV promoters
Figure 1 depicts the locations and the directions of the promoter fragments in the TYLCV (3 fragments) and WmCSV (2 fragments) genomes. These fragments represent the MP gene promoters in both viruses as well as the CP promoter gene of TYLCV (Table 1). To facilitate cloning of the fragments, the restriction sites for HindIII and BglII were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of all MP promoters, and to the 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively, of CP promoters fragments.Fig. 1 Schematic drawing of viral genomes. a

For the putative MP promoters of both TYLCV and WmCSV, we designed specific primers to amplify both the entire putative promoter, respectively, called TMPTY-pro (~570 bp in size, specific primers PGLH and PGLB) (accession no. KP419702) and TMPWm-pro (~750 bp, primers PEH1 and PEB1) (accession no. KP657700), and a smaller “minimal” fragment, respectively, called MMPTY-pro (~300 bp, PGSH and PGSB) and MMPWm-pro (~550 bp, PEH2 and PEB2). One set of specific primers, CPB and CPH, was used to amplify the CP promoter (CPTY-pro; ~570 bp in size). Table 2 showed the oligonucleotide sequences of all primers sets used to amplify the promoter fragments.Table 2 Oligonucleotide primers used to amplify different sized promoter fragments from geminiviruses

Plasmid pTYNA101 (Abdallah et al. 1993) containing the full genome of TYLCV-Egyptian strain (Eg) was the template for amplifying the different sized promoter fragments of TYLCV. Restriction-digested (HindIII–BglII) fragments were individually cloned into the plasmid pMONRTG (Liu 2003) from which the 35S promoter had been excised, creating a GUS reporter gene under the control of the promoter fragment, i.e. two sizes of the MP promoter and one size of the CP promoter. The three pro::GUS constructs were excised using HindIII and EcoRI and ligated into a modified pCAMBIA1390 binary vector after excision of its 35S promoter.

Purified WmCSV preparations of the Sudan isolate (Kheyr-Pour et al. 2000) were used as a template for amplifying the different sized promoter fragments of WmCSV. Each restriction-digested (HindIII–BglII) promoter fragment was cloned into pMONRTG after the excision of its 35S promoter to yield a GUS reporter gene under the promoter’s control. The two constructs, TMPWm-pro::GUS and MMPWm-pro::GUS, were released from the vector using HindIII and BamHI. These fragments were then ligated into a modified pCAMBIA1390 binary vector after excising its e35S promoter.

Bioinformatics analyses
Subsequently, the five promoter fragments were sequenced using an ABI 3730xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), after cloning in pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA). These sequences and that of the e35S promoter were analysed using Web Signal Scan (http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/signalscan.html) (Prestridge 1991).

Agrobacterium strains and constructs
The five promoter constructs and pCAMBIA3301 were transformed into Agrobacterium strain GV3101 (Koncz and Schell 1986) by electroporation (Sukharev et al. 1992) for explant agroinfiltration. A construct with GUS under the control of the e35S promoter (GV3101::pCAMBIA3301) was used as a positive control for the GUS reporter gene. The five constructs each harboured the GUS gene in pCAMBIA1390 under control of a test promoter fragment: the large (GV3101::TMPTY-pro) or small (GV3101::MMPTY-pro) fragment of the TYLCV MP promoter; or the large (GV3101::TMPWm-pro) or small (GV3101::MMPWm-pro) fragment of the WmCSV-MP promoter. GV3101 was used a negative control.

Agrobacterium infiltration
Agroinfiltration was carried out on watermelon, tomato, and rice explants. Agrobacterium cultures were grown overnight at 28 °C in liquid LB medium supplemented with 50 mg/L kanamycin and 10 mg/L rifampicin. When cultures reached about 0.8 at OD600, cells were harvested and diluted by re-suspending and incubating in MES buffer (10 mM MES/KOH, pH 5.6 and 10 mM MgCl2) for 2 h at room temperature to a final concentration of 1.0 at OD600. Tomato, watermelon, and rice explants were submerged separately in one of the seven Agrobacterium-suspension cultures and placed inside desiccators for infiltration at 200 mbar for 5 min. The infiltrated explants were incubated in the dark and assayed for GUS activity after 3 days.

Detection of GUS expression
GUS expression was visually evaluated using the histochemical assay of Jefferson et al. (1987). The GUS reaction was performed 3 days post-agroinfiltration by incubating the samples with GUS buffer solution containing 1 mM 5-bromo-4-choloro-3-indolyl-β-glucuronic acid overnight at 37 °C. The blue colour was detected visually by the naked eye and using a light microscope (LEICA Icc 50 HD-DM750, Wetzlar, Germany) after bleaching the chlorophyll with 70 % ethanol.

Quantitative GUS assay
A quantitative fluorescent assay was performed to evaluate GUS expression using the substrate 4-methylumbelliferylgalactopyranoside (MUG) and the FluorAce™ β-glucuronidase Reporter Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein was extracted from each sample, with five replicates for each putative promoter in each type of explant (tomato, watermelon and rice). Each sample (5 µg) was incubated with 1 mM MUG buffer at 37 °C for 15 min. Stop buffer (1×) was used to terminate the reaction. The fluorescent molecule 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) was released by hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate by GUS. Fluorescence of 4MU was measured with a Versafluor fluorometer (Bio-Rad) using an emission wavelength of 460 nm and an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. A fresh preparation of 100 nM 4MU was used as a calibration standard. GUS activity was then calculated as the production of 4MU from MUG in pmol/min/µg of protein. The mean GUS activity from the e35S promoter of pCAMBIA3301 was considered to be 100 % and used to standardize the activities from promoters in other constructs.

Results
Isolation, sequencing, and analysis of promoter fragments
Dissection analysis of the five promoter regions isolated from TYLCV and WmCSV can assist in identifying cis-acting signals and their interactions with trans-acting factors that contribute to eukaryotic gene expression. The isolated fragments were amplified using specific primers, cloned, and sequenced. The sequences were analysed for the presence of cis-acting elements that could affect transcription efficiency. The resulting motifs were counted and their loci recorded.

The motifs in the five promoter regions and their frequencies were compared with those of e35S-pro (Fig. 2). To investigate the efficiencies of the regulatory regions, the fragments were cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 binary vector to replace the e35S promoter driving GUS expression (Fig. 3). Agroinfiltration was used to introduce the constructs into tomato, watermelon plantlets and rice callus to test the promoter efficiencies in dicots and a monocot.Fig. 2 Conserved motif frequencies in putative promoters CPTY-pro, TMPTY-pro, MMPTY-pro, TMPWm-pro, MMPWm-pro and e35S-pro

In silico identification of regulatory motifs and data analysis
In silico comparisons of the orthologous promoter fragments were performed using Web Signal Scan. Five conserved motifs were detected in all five putative promoters as well as the e35S promoter: ACGTATERD1 (5′-ACGT-3′), ARR1AT (5′-NGATT-3′) (Sakai et al. 2000), CAATBOX1 (5′-CAAT-3′), DOFCOREZM (5′-AAAG-3′) (Yanagisawa and Schmidt 1999), and GATABOX (5′-GATA-3′). Their positions and frequencies in our putative promoter fragments are shown in Table 3.Table 3 Positions and the frequencies of the five conserved motifs present in CPTY-pro, TMPTY-pro, MMPTY-pro, TMPWm-pro, MMPWm-pro and e35S-pro

Bioinformatics analysis also revealed unique cis-elements in some fragments: CPTY-pro contained ERELEE4 (5′-AWTTCAAA-3′) at positions 266, 273, and 280 URR; HEXMOTIFTAH3H4 (5′-ACGTCA-3′) at position 376 URR; PYRIMIDINEBOXOSRAMY1A (5′-CCTTTT-3′) at positions 337 and 343 URR; and SORLIP1AT (5′-GCCAC-2′) at positions 583, 581, and 619 URR. Both TMPTY-pro and MMPTY-pro contained RAV1AAT (5′-CACCA-3′) at positions 154 and 611 URR and 20 URR, respectively; ARFAT (5′-TGTCTC-3′) at positions 405 and 445 URR. TMPWm-pro and MMPWm-pro both contained BOXIINTPATPB (5′-ATGAGAA-3′) at position 422 URR.

In TMPTY-pro and MMPTY-pro (Fig. 4a, b), the ARR1AT represented 8 and 15 % of the promoter fragment lengths, respectively. The motifs CAATBOX1, DOFCOREZM, EECCRCAH1 (5′-GANTTNC-3′), GT1CONSENSUS (5′-GRWAAW-3′), GTGANTG10 (5′-GTGA-3′), WRKY71OS (5′-TGAC-3′) each represented 7 % of MMPTY-pro and 8, 6, 3, 5, and 3 %, respectively, of TMPTY-pro. Each of the other motifs comprised 4 % of MMPTY-pro and 2–5 % in TMPTY-pro. In TMPWm-pro and MMPWm-pro (Fig. 4c, d), the TATABOX5 comprised 13 % of MMPWm-pro and 8 % of TMPWm-pro. The motifs CAATBOX1, ARR1AT, and CACTFTPPCA1 (5′-YACT-3′) each made up 10 % of MMPWm-pro and 8 % of TMPWm-pro. Other motifs differed only slightly.Fig. 4 Composition of the promoters. a TMPTY-pro contained 59 conserved boxes; CAATBOX1 had the highest frequency (8 %). b MMPTY-pro comprised 26 conserved boxes, and ARR1AT was the most frequent (15 %). c TMPWm-pro had 48 conserved, with the most frequent being CAATBOX1 (8 %). d MMPWm-pro included 31 conserved boxes; TATABOX5 had the highest frequency (13 %)



TATABOX4, TATABOX5, and TATABOXOSPAL were detected in TMPTY-pro, while they were completely absent in MMPTY-pro. TATABOX4 and TATABOX5 were recorded in TMPWm-pro and MMPWm-pro. Table 4 shows the distribution of TATA boxes within the five promoter regions and e35S-pro. Remarkably, CPTY-pro harboured the highest number of the cis-acting elements within its DNA sequence among the promoter regions (data are not shown).Table 4 TATA box distributions and frequencies within CPTY-pro, TMPTY-pro, MMPTY-pro, TMPWm-pro, MMPWm-pro and the e35S promoter

Histochemical GUS assays
To determine the expression levels of each putative promoter, tomato, watermelon, and rice were infiltrated with the five prepared constructs. Histochemical GUS assays were performed 3 days after Agrobacterium infiltration. The assays revealed different intensities of blue GUS activity among the TMPTY-pro, MMPTY-pro, TMPWm-pro, MMPWm-pro, and e35S-pro constructs in all tested tissues, while CPTY-pro yielded no GUS activity. MMPTY-pro, the minor fragment of the MP promoter of TYLCV, showed the highest intensity blue colour. The expression pattern of each putative promoter was monitored in transverse sections of infiltrated tomato tissues. Blue staining with MMPTY-pro was observed clearly in vascular bundle as well as the palisade mesophyll and spongy mesophyll (Fig. 5b, c). MMPWm-pro showed the next highest intensity of GUS activity, with blue staining in xylem and phloem cells and in secondary vascular bundles (Fig. 5e). Expression of TMPTY-pro and TMPWm-pro was detected in mature xylem and phloem cells of the infiltrated tomato tissues (Fig. 5d, f), with a similar intensity to the e35S promoter (Fig. 5a). Although CPTY-pro harboured the most cis-acting elements within its length, it did not promote GUS expression in any of the plants.Fig. 5 Histochemical localization of GUS transient expression. a pCambia3301. b, c pMMPTY. d pTMPTY. e pMMPWm. f pTMPWm.

Quantitative GUS assay
To precisely determine the expression level of each putative promoter, quantitative fluorometric assays were done to measure promoter efficiency in driving GUS in tomato, watermelon, and rice. Five replicates of each promoter in each type of explant were subjected to this assay. 3 days post-agroinfiltration, the mean values of the replicates were calculated and plotted (Fig. 6). CPTY-pro was not analysed because it showed no activity during the histochemical GUS assay.Fig. 6 Quantitative fluorometric assay for the truncated promoters in a tomato, the main host for TYLCV; b watermelon, the main host for WmCSV; and c rice, a monocot



In general, MMPTY-pro and MMPWm-pro had higher GUS expression levels than the longer fragments TMPTY-pro and TMPWm-pro in both dicot and monocot plants. Moreover, the minor fragment MMPTY-pro showed higher expression than the minor fragment MMPWm-pro. The e35S promoter activity was lowest among the putative promoters in the monocot plant.

In tomato, which is the main host of TYLCV, the highest GUS activity was driven by the truncated promoter MMPTY, followed by MMPWm-pro, then e35S-pro and TMPTY-pro (with nearly equal activities), and finally TMPWm-pro (Fig. 6a). In watermelon, the main host of WmCSV, GUS had the highest level of expression when driven by MMPTY-pro, followed by MMPWm-pro, TMPTY-pro, and TMPWm-pro and e35S (with nearly identical levels; Fig. 6b). Rice was used to evaluate these promoters in monocots; GUS assays indicated that the highest level of expression was obtained when the gene was controlled by MMPTY-pro, followed by MMPWm-pro, TMPTY-pro, TMPWm-pro, and finally e35S (Fig. 6c).

Discussion
Promoters are regulatory regions that control gene expression in eukaryotes, which require exceptionally precise systems to regulate complex expression patterns involving thousands of genes (McKenna and O’Malley 2002a, b; Narlikar et al. 2002; Orphanides and Reinberg 2002). The promoters of plant viruses have great potential for plant biotechnology to engineer recombinant proteins with higher yields rapidly and at large scales (Pogue et al. 2002). Viruses such as Potato virus X, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Alfalfa mosaic virus, Cucumber mosaic virus, and Cowpea mosaic virus have been used as expression vectors to produce recombinant proteins, like vaccine antigens (Donson et al. 1991; Chapman et al. 1992; Yusibov et al. 1997; Lomonossoff and Hamilton 1999; Zhao et al. 2000; Sanchez-Navarro et al. 2001; Pogue et al. 2002; Yusibov and Rabindran 2004).

The more basic knowledge we have on fundamental transcription elements in active promoters, the more efficient in vitro transcription we can perform in the future. Plant promoters that are activated precisely when and where needed would be ideal for genetic engineering. Therefore, the isolation and characterization of new effective functional plant promoters is highly desirable. To advance this goal, five putative promoter regions were isolated from two geminiviruses with bidirectional gene transcription from a stretch of DNA containing the core promoter region.

By comparing the different cis-elements present in each of our putative promoters and the promoters’ quantitative fluorescent GUS assays, we were able to make some valuable observations, which will significantly enhance future research on promoter architectures and activities. MMPTY-pro, which conferred the highest level of GUS expression, had the fewest conserved motifs (26 cis-acting elements), followed by MMPWm-pro (31). Although CPTY-Pro had the most elements, it did not promote expression. Interestingly, although CPTY-pro is a TATA-less promoter, this fact did not explain its behaviour, this observation is consistent with the observation of Khan et al. 2015) when it has observed a weak activity of CLCuBuV CP promoter which has been explained to probably be due to the absence of AC2 gene product in CLCuBuV (Amrao et al. 2010). The role of transactivator AC2 protein for activation of virion sense promoter which has already been reported (Hong et al. 1996 and Sunter et al. 1990) and may have a great effect on the activity of CP promoter. Gene expression process in geminivirus happens by an early expression of complimentary sense gene, whose products are then participating in viral replication such as AC1 (Rep) or they may act as transcription activator for the virion sense gene expression, such as AC2 (TrAp). In contrast, the expression of virion sense genes usually appears later and requires complimentary sense gene product/products for activation (Ashraf et al. 2014). We have observed that the MMPTY-pro, which had the highest expression levels, was TATA-less like the CP which means that the TATA box had no great effect on the promoter activity in our case.

TATABOXes (TATABOX4, TATABOX5, TATABOXOSPAL) comprised 2 % of e35S-pro, 16 % of MMPWm-pro, 10 % of TMPWm-pro, and 8 % of TMPTY-pro. With TATABOX-dependent core promoters, the transcription factors (TFs) can assemble into a pre-initiation complex in the following order: TFIID, TFIIB, RNA polymerase II-TFIIF complex, TFIIF, and then TFIIH. TFIID consists of TBP (TATA box-binding protein) and about 13 TBP-associated factors (Burley and Roeder 1996; Albright and Tjian 2000; Berk 2000; Verrijzer 2001; Tora 2002), while TFIIB is single polypeptide that interacts with TBP as well as DNA upstream of the TATA box. In TATA-less promoters (e.g. CPTY-pro and MMPTY-pro), DPE is the downstream core promoter binding site of TFIID (Burke and Kadonaga 1996).

Remarkably the brightest blue colour of GUS promoted by MMPTY-pro, the TATA-less promoter, was observed constitutively in vascular bundles, spongy mesophyll, palisade mesophyll, and in the green plastids within palisade cells of tomato leaves. This result agrees with Erb and van Nimwegen (2011), who stated that TATA-less promoters are expressed in a constitutive manner and enriched for house-keeping genes, whereas TATA-containing promoters show variability in expression, and are often induced in response to stress. Our other putative promoters showed different expression patterns within plant tissues. The GUS staining derived from pMMPWm, with the second most intense levels, occurred in mature xylem and phloem, as well as in secondary vascular bundles. This staining was restricted to mature xylem and phloem in pTMPTY, pTMPWm, and pCAMBIA3301.

The activity results proved that the smaller fragments of the promoters were more efficient than their larger corresponding fragments. Comparing both activity level and the cis-acting elements present within the small MMPTY-pro and the large TMPTY-pro, we found that ARR1AT, GT1CONSENSUS, GTGANTG10, ACGTATERD1, WRKY71OS, EECCRCAH1, and ASF1MOTIFCAMV comprised 15, 7, 7, 4, 7, 7, and 4 %, respectively, of MMPTY-pro and 8, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, and 2 %, respectively, of TMPTY-pro. In the WmCSV promoter fragments, TATABOX5, ARR1AT, CAATBOX1, CACFTPPCA1, ARFAT, and ASF1MOTIFCAMV made up 10, 10, 10, 10, 6, and 6 %, respectively, of the small MMPWm-pro and 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, and 4 %, respectively, of the large TMPWm-pro. Therefore, we postulate that the frequency of some cis-acting elements within the promoter region plays a crucial role in the promoter’s efficiency.

In this study, ARR1AT BOX, which comprised 15 % of MMPTY-pro and 8 % of TMPTY-pro, may have had a positive effect on the promoter’s efficiency. This motif made up 10 % of MMPWm-pro and 8 % of TMPWm-pro. ARR1 belongs to the MYB TF family and is one of seven members in the largest subclass of type-B ARRs (Sakai et al. 2000; Imamura et al. 2003; Tajima et al. 2004; Taniguchi et al. 2007). The MYP TF family is present in all eukaryotes. All members have the N-terminus MYP DNA-binding domain (Nero et al. 2009). ARR1 mediates cytokinin signal responses (Sakai et al. 2000, 2001; Hwang and Sheen 2001). Therefore, increasing the frequency of the ARR1AT BOX within our putative truncated promoters map explain the elevated GUS activity in both of our minor fragment promoters. Because BAP was used as a cytokinin source in all of our tissue cultures, it acted as a positive signal that enhanced the response of the ARR1 DNA-binding domain to the ARR1AT BOX. Consequently, the GUS expression was considerably increased by the truncated putative promoters.

ASF1MOTIFCAMV is another element that made up a greater percentage of the promoter region in both MMPTY-pro (4 %) and MMPWm-pro (6 %) compared with TMPTY-pro (2 %) and TMPWm-pro (4 %), respectively. This motif comprised 4 % of the e35S promoter and reacts with the ASF-1 cellular factor (Lam et al. 1989).

Another element, WRKY71OS, is a member of the W-BOX. WRKY is one of the largest transcriptional regulator families in the plant kingdom and is considered as an essential part of the signalling pathways that moderates many plant processes. WRKYs are proposed to perform a regulatory role in resistance transcriptome amid the W-box element [(C/T)TGAC(C/T] (Eulgem and Somssich 2007), and an enormous number of WRKY genes are up-regulated by pathogen infection (Maleck et al. 2000; Dong et al. 2003; Glazebrook et al. 2003; Kalde et al. 2003; Eulgem and Somssich 2007). Specific WRKY proteins have been proven to regulate plant immune responses. Arabidopsis WRKY52/RRS1 helps in defence against the Ralstonia solanacearum bacterium. Another Arabidopsis WRKY70 acts as a positive regulator of salicylic acid-dependent defence mechanisms (Li et al. 2004, 2006). Therefore, elevating the frequency of WRKY1OS in MMPTY-pro may be another mechanism to enhance GUS expression, because the Agrobacterium that we used to introduce our constructs into the explants is considered to be a biotic stress that can induce the WRKY TFs to initiate immune signalling cascades by binding to their proper element, in this case WRKY1OS.

In contrast, our analysis found that MYBCORATCYCB, MYCCONSESUSAT, MYB2CONSENSHSA MYBCORE, POLLEN1LELAT52, SEF1MOTIF, LEAFYATAG, LECPLEACS2, and POLASIG2 had been completely deleted from MMPTY-pro, while MYCCONSESUSAT, POLLEN1LELAT52, POLASIG1, GTGANTG10, and GT1CONSENSUS had been completely deleted from MMPWm-pro, although they were present in the longer versions of these promoters. This result suggested that the deletion of some elements could decrease the competition of different TFs for their specific elements within the promoter region.

The five conserved domains ARR1AT, CAATBOX1, ACGTATERD1, GATABOX, and DOFCOREZM were common in all of our putative promoters and in the 35S promoter. CAATBOX1 occupies a considerable proportion of our putative promoter fragments: 10 % in MMWm-pro, 9 % in CPTY-pro, 8 % in TMPWm-pro and TMPTY-pro, 7 % in MMPTY-pro, and finally 5 % within e35S. This motif is responsible for the tissue-specific promotion of the pea legumin gene LegA (Shirsat et al. 1989) and occurs within the pvPDF promoter. The ACGTATERD1 domain is required for etiolation-induced expression of erd1 (early response to dehydration) in Arabidopsis. GATABOXes are required for high-level light-regulated and tissue-specific gene expression. GATA TFs are a group of DNA-binding proteins distinguished by a zinc finger motif that have been implicated in light- and nitrate-dependent transcription control (Reyes et al. 2004). GATA TFs are reported to bind the CaMV 35S promoter and are conserved in cab promoters as well (Lam et al. 1989). DOFCOREZM is the target binding site of Dof proteins, which are specific DNA-binding proteins associated with the expression of multiple genes in plants. Dof proteins also differentially regulate diverse promoters in a variety of plant tissues (Yanagisawa and Schmidt 1999).

Gene expression, and thus protein biosynthesis, does not depend only on the presence of functional cis-elements, but also on how and when the trans-acting elements interact with their proper elements and also on the activity of RNA polymerase II. The transcriptome activation of CPTY-pro is mediated by transactivation of the C2, which might explain the silent expression of this putative promoter.

Conclusions
The information that we have elucidated on the begomoviral promoter of TYLCV and WmCSV, a very distinct Old World and newly emerged begomovirus, would help in further elucidating transcription regulation in begomoviruses. Thus, generating more efficient tools in producing transgenes.

ARR1AT, GT1CONSENSUS, GTGANTG10, ACGTATERD1, WRKY71OS, EECCRCAH1, ASF1MOTIFCAMV, TATABOX5, CAATBOX1, CACFTPPCA1 and ARFAT might be strong candidates for enhancing transcription. The constitutive expression profile of MMPTY-pro can be explained by the fact that it is a TATA-less promoter. In future work, we intend to investigate the capability of these recommended motifs to enhance promoter activity for large-scale in vitro protein production.

In addition to PAMPs, PRRs recognize endogenous molecules released from damaged tissue or dead cells [damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)] and activate signaling cascades to induce inflammatory processes. In the aquatic environment, large variation in seasonal and diurnal water temperature causes heat and cold stresses in fish, resulting in tissue injury and mortality of fish. In the Indian subcontinent, catla (Catla catla) is an economically important freshwater fish species and is prone to thermal stresses. To investigate the response of pattern recognition receptors in thermal stress, we analyzed TLRs (TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5) and NOD (NOD1 and NOD2) receptors gene expression in catla following heat and cold stress. Analysis of tissue samples (gill, liver, kidney and blood) of the thermal stressed and control fish by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay revealed significant (p < 0.05) induction of TLR2, TLR4 and NOD2 gene expression in majority of the tested tissues of the treated fish as compared to the control. The expression of TLR5 and NOD1 gene was also induced in the heat and cold stressed fish, but mostly restricted in the blood. The downstream signaling molecule of TLR and NOD signaling pathway viz., MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88) and RICK (receptor interacting serine-threonine protein kinase-2) was also induced in the thermal stressed fish suggesting the engagement of TLR and NOD signaling pathway during thermal stress.

Introduction
The success of aquaculture depends on providing an optimum and congenial environment to fish which subsequently helps to achieve their higher survival rate and growth (Boyd and Tucker 1998). The health status of aquatic animals is uniquely influenced by their immediate surroundings viz., pH, salinity, temperature, ambient light intensity, presence of contaminants, dissolved oxygen concentration etc. (Tort 2011). Among these, temperature is one the most important abiotic factors that plays a critical role in the life of poikilothermic animals like fish (Fry 1971; Brett 1971; Stewart et al. 2002). Various fish species differ in requirement of their optimal temperature (Sharma et al. 2014). Beyond that limit, fishes experience the thermal stress resulting in tissue injury and are prone to be infected by opportunistic pathogens (Das et al. 2004; Gordon 2005; Dalvi et al. 2009). To defend against pathogenic invasion, fish primarily depend upon non-specific or innate immunity contributed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) receptors. In addition to the PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) recognition, TLRs sense DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) which are endogenous host molecules viz., fibronectin (Okamura et al. 2001), heparin sulfate (Johnson et al. 2002), biglycan (Schaefer et al. 2005), fibrinogen (Smiley et al. 2001), oligosaccharides of hyaluronan breakdown products (Jiang et al. 2005; Taylor et al. 2004, 2007), heat shock proteins (Yu et al. 2010), high mobility group box1 (HMGB1) (Tang et al. 2011), tenascin-C (Midwood et al. 2009), cardiac myosin (Zhang et al. 2009), S100 proteins, thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) (Yu et al. 2010) etc. Physiologically, these endogenous ligands are localized under different cellular compartment, but under stress they are either released passively from the injured tissues/dying cells or actively secreted by activated cells via non-conventional lysosomal route (Pollanen et al. 2009). Endogenous TLR ligands act as alarmins and may serve as early warning signals to innate and adaptive immunity (Matzinger 2002; Seong and Matzinger 2004). Recognition of DAMPs by PRRs activates signaling cascade resulting in the induction of cytokines, recruitment of more immune cells and repair of damaged tissue (Medzhitov 2008). In addition to TLRs, NOD-like receptors (NLRs) have also been shown to respond to both microbial components (Franchi et al. 2012) and endogenous ligands derived from tissue/cellular injuries (Ting et al. 2008; Tschopp and Schroder 2010; Krishnaswamy et al. 2013; Monie 2013).

The global climate is rapidly changing, resulting in significant shift in water temperatures and stresses in various fish species (Jain and Kumar 2012). The variation in water temperature has been shown to modulate the expression of TLR gene transcripts in zebrafish (Danio rerio) (Sundaram et al. 2012). In India, among various freshwater fish species, catla (Catla catla) is one of the most commercially important and highly favored fish in the farming industry. Therefore, this work was undertaken to investigate the response of TLRs and NOD receptors in catla during thermal stresses.

Materials and methods
Fish
Catla fry (0.676 ± 0.026 g) was obtained from a local fish farm and was stocked in 50 L glass aquaria in the wet laboratory. Before the start of the experiment, acclimatization was carried out for 3-weeks at 25 °C to avoid the handling stress. The fish was fed twice a day with laboratory prepared feed (40 % protein) at the rate of 5 % of their body weight. Aeration was constant to maintain high oxygen level (6.21–7.14 mg/l) and the continuous mixing of water throughout the study period.

Thermal stress and sampling
Fish were randomly distributed in 12 glass aquaria each containing 40 fish. Each aquarium was connected with a filtration unit and a cooling/heating unit. This helped to maintain desirable temperature in the aquarium. The used water from fish culture unit was first circulated into the filtration unit, then to the cooling or heating unit, and finally into the fish culture unit. The ambient temperature was 25 ± 2 °C during this period. Fish acclimatized at 25 °C were exposed to six different temperature viz. 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 °C. Two replicates were used for each temperature. The 25 °C temperature was considered as ambient temperature (control). Two groups were maintained above and three groups were below the control temperature. Each experimental temperature was achieved with change of temperature at 1 °C/12 h starting from acclimatization temperature of 25 °C. In this way, the treated aquaria attained 20 and 30 °C after 2.5 days, and 10 °C after 7.5 days.

For sampling, fish were collected from each tank (n = 10) after 12 h of achieving the assigned temperature to study the immediate effect of stress after exposure. Then again fish were collected after 7 days to study the effect of chronic stress. Total two samplings were conducted in all treatments, except at 10 °C because fish died before second sampling. Fish were taken out from experimental tank, anesthetized with MS-222 (Sigma, USA) following which gill, liver, kidney and blood were collected separately in TRIzol reagent for RNA extraction and further study.

RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from TRIzol reagent-treated sample following the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, USA). The concentration of RNA was measured by UV-spectrophotometer (Biophotometer Plus, Eppendorf, Germany), and the quality was assessed by observing the intensity of 28 and 18S rRNA (ribosomal RNA) band in 1 % agarose gel. To synthesize the first strand cDNA (complementary DNA), 1 µg of total RNA was first treated with 1 unit of DNase I (MBI, Fermentas, USA), and was reverse transcribed with oligo-dT primer and RevertAid 1st strand cDNA synthesis kit (MBI, Fermentas, USA). The PCR-amplification of β-actin gene was carried out for the confirmation of cDNA synthesis.

To study the basal expression of innate immune genes (TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, NOD1 and NOD2) in gill, liver, kidney and blood of catla fry, and their in vivo modulation following variations in water temperatures, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed. The qRT-PCR was performed in LightCycler® 480 II real-time PCR detection system (Roche, Germany), and in a 10 µl reaction volume the following reagents were added: cDNA-1 µl, FW and RV primer (2.5 µM each; Table 1) 0.25 µl each, 2X LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I master mix (Roche, Germany) 5 µl and PCR grade water 3.5 µl. PCR amplifications were performed in triplicate wells under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 51 °C (MyD88)/55 °C (TLR4)/56 °C (NOD1)/58 °C (TLR2, TLR5, RICK and β-actin)/60 °C (NOD2) for 10 s and 72 °C for 10 s. For negative control, qRT-PCR reaction without cDNA was considered. To determine PCR efficiencies, qRT-PCR with serial dilutions of cDNA was carried out. The efficiencies were ~100 %, that allowed the use of 2−ΔΔCT method to calculate relative gene expression of the target genes with that of reference gene, β-actin. In a 2 % agarose gel, 8 µl of the real-time PCR products were loaded to verify the specificity of the product size. The relative expression ratios were obtained by normalizing expression of the target gene, as determined by mean crossing point (cp) deviation, by that of reference gene, β-actin following 2−ΔΔCT method (Livak and Schmittgen 2001). The data obtained from qRT-PCR analysis were expressed as mean of two experiments ± standard error (SE), and the significant difference between control and treated groups at each time point was determined by the Student’s t test using Microsoft Excel 2010 with p < 0.05 as significance level.Table 1 Primers used for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis

Results and discussion
Tissue specific expression of innate immune genes
The data of qRT-PCR revealed wide expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, NOD1 and NOD2 genes across the tested organs/tissues, but the magnitude of their expression varied. Lowest expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 was observed in blood. As compared to the blood, TLR2 gene expression in gill and kidney was ~5.5 fold (Fig. 1a), and TLR4 and TLR5 in liver was ~7 fold (Fig. 1b) and ~150 fold (Fig. 1c), respectively. Among the NOD receptors, least expression of NOD1 was detected in blood and the highest (~7 fold) was in liver (Fig. 1d). In contrast, NOD2 expression was lowest in liver and highest (~20 fold) in blood (Fig. 1e). The expression of TLR2, TLR5, NOD1 and NOD2 gene in the embryonic developmental stages and in various organs/tissues was previously been reported in Labeo rohita (Samanta et al. 2012; Swain et al. 2012, 2013a, b) and Cirrhinus mrigala (Basu et al. 2012a, b, 2013). Catla is a closely related fish to rohu and mrigal. Therefore, the expression of TLR and NOD genes in gill, liver, kidney and blood was expected. The constitutive expression of TLR and NOD genes may indicate their availability as innate immune receptor in the early developmental stages of catla.Fig. 1 Tissue specific basal expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, NOD1 and NOD2 gene. Total RNA was extracted from gill, liver, kidney and blood of catla fry. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out to analyze TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, NOD1 and NOD2 gene expression among the tissues. Expressions of these gene transcripts were represented as a ratio relative to β-actin (internal control) levels in the same samples. The tissue which showed lowest expression of respective gene was chosen as calibrator (1), and the relative expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, NOD1 and NOD2 gene in other tissues was represented as fold changes from the calibrator. The results were expressed as mean ± standard error (bars in the graph) from ten fish (n = 10). a TLR2, b TLR4, c TLR5, d NOD1 and e NOD2 gene expression



Modulation of TLR and NOD gene expression
We monitored immediate (12 h post-exposure) and late (7 days post-exposure) response of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, NOD1 and NOD2 receptors in catla fry by analyzing the tissue samples (gill, liver, kidney and blood) of control fish (fish maintained at 25 °C), cold stressed fish (exposed to 10, 15 and 20 °C) and heat stressed fish (exposed to 30 and 35 °C) through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. At 7 days post-exposure, all catla fry remained alive at 15, 20, 30 and 35 °C, but at 10 °C, all fish died.

Toll-like receptor-2
In response to the early (12 h) thermal stress, TLR2 gene expression was significantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated in gill, liver, kidney and blood of the treated fish as compared to control (Fig. 2a). In gill, TLR2 expression was highest at 20 °C (~10 fold) and it declined gradually with further lowering of temperature. A similar trend of TLR2 expression was also observed in liver, kidney and blood at 20 and 15 °C. At 10 °C, TLR2 expression was found to be suppressed in all tested tissues. Due to heat stress, TLR2 induction in gill, liver, kidney and blood was also increased at 30 and 35 °C. Among the organs, maximum induction of TLR2 was observed in liver at 30 °C (~6 fold) followed by gill and blood. Fish exposed at 35 °C expressed higher TLR2 in all tested tissues than the control fish maintained at 25 °C. During late thermal stress (7 days), the pattern of TLR2 gene expression in gill, liver and kidney was almost similar as observed in early (12 h) thermal stress but the magnitude of the response in terms of fold change was different (Fig. 2b). In contrast to other tissues, TLR2 gene expression in blood was down-regulated in the treated fish group as compared to control.Fig. 2 TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 gene expression in thermal stress. Total RNA was extracted from gill, liver, kidney, and blood from the control and treated fish, at 12 h and 7 days post-exposure, and quantitative real-time PCR was conducted to analyze TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 gene expression keeping β-actin as housekeeping control gene. The results were calculated as mean ± standard error (bars in the graph) and were shown as fold changes compared to control. Significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and treated fish group was indicated with asterisks. TLR2 gene expression at 12 h (a) and 7 days (b); TLR4 gene expression at 12 h (c) and 7 days (d) and TLR5 gene expression at 12 h (e) and 7 days (f) post-treatment



Toll-like receptor-4
The organ/tissue specific modulation of TLR4 was detected in thermal stressed fish at 12 h post-exposure as compared to control fish (Fig. 2c). In gill, TLR4 expression was down-regulated at all experimental temperatures as compared to control. In liver, except at 10 °C, a similar trend of TLR4 gene expression was also observed. In kidney, a significant induction of TLR4 was noted at 10 °C, and at higher temperatures (30 and 35 °C) it was down-regulated. In blood, highest induction of TLR4 gene expression was observed at 10 °C as compared to the control fish. At 7 days post-thermal stress (Fig. 2d), TLR4 gene expression in gill, liver and kidney of cold and heat stressed fish showed down-regulation. However, in blood there was marginal increase in TLR gene expression at 20 °C, which reached to its peak at 15 °C (~7 fold). There was moderate increase in TLR4 gene expression at 30 and 35 °C (~2 fold) as compared to the control fish.

Toll-like receptor-5
The induction of TLR5 gene expression in thermal stressed fish was also tissue specific as compared to the control fish. At 12 h post-exposure, TLR5 was down-regulated in gill and liver at all experimental temperatures (Fig. 2e). In kidney, TLR5 expression showed a marginal increase at 15 °C (~1.7 fold) and 20 °C (~1.4 fold) as compared to control, but at other temperatures it remained almost unchanged. In blood, the pattern of TLR5 gene expression was strikingly different from other tested tissues. As compared to the control, most significant (p < 0.05) induction of TLR5 was observed in blood during cold stress at 10 °C (~14 fold) and heat stress at 30 °C (~13 fold). At 7 days post-thermal stress, except in gill, the trend of TLR5 gene expression in liver, kidney and blood of treated fish group was almost similar to 12 h post-thermal stress (Fig. 2f). In the treated fish gill, TLR5 gene expression was up-regulated at 20 °C as compared to the control fish.

The TLR2 and TLR4 are reported to be responsible for recognition of heat shock proteins (Hsp60, Hsp90 and Gp96), HMGB1 (Tsan and Gao 2004) and hyaluronan-induced inflammatory response (Jiang et al. 2005; Noble and Jiang 2006). Similarly, in catla, the activation of TLR2 and TLR4 is likely to be mediated through Hsp during heat stress and HMGB1 released from the necrotic cells (Tsung et al. 2005). In addition to these, other endogenous TLR ligands released from damaged tissue and cells may activate TLRs. Recognition of endogenous ligands by TLR5 was previously been reported in rheumatoid arthritis (Chamberlain et al. 2012). In catla, significant induction of TLR5 gene expression in blood suggests tissue injury resulting in the release of endogenous TLR5 ligands. However, further works are necessary to draw any conclusion in this regard.

Nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-1
We next analyzed NOD1 gene expression in thermal stressed and control fish at 12 h post-exposure (Fig. 3a). Among all tested tissues, the most significant induction (p < 0.05) of NOD1 was observed in blood. During cold stress, NOD1 expression in blood was ~2.7 fold at 20 °C, and it reached the peak (~3 fold) at 10 °C. In heat stress, there was gradual increase in NOD1 expression at 30 °C (~1.3 fold) and 35 °C (~2.6 fold). In gill, NOD1 gene expression was observed to be slightly induced or remained unchanged. In liver and kidney, down-regulation of NOD1 was observed in response to cold as well as heat shock. As shown in Fig. 3b, NOD1 gene expression in cold and heat exposed fish gill and liver remained down-regulated at all tested temperatures after 7 days post-exposure. However, in kidney it was up-regulated (~1.6 fold) only at 20 °C as compared to the control fish. In blood, NOD1 expression remained down-regulated at 15, 30 and 35 °C, but a marginal up-regulation was observed at 20 °C in the treated fish group.Fig. 3 NOD1 and NOD2 gene expression in thermal stress. Total RNA was extracted from gill, liver, kidney, and blood from the control and treated fish, at 12 h and 7 days post-exposure, and quantitative real-time PCR was conducted to analyze NOD1 and NOD2 gene expression keeping β-actin as housekeeping control gene. The results were calculated as mean ± standard error (bars in the graph) and were shown as fold changes compared to control. Significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and treated fish group was indicated with asterisks. NOD1 gene expression at 12 h (a) and 7 days (b); NOD2 gene expression at 12 h (c) and 7 days (d)



Nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-2
The effect of thermal stress (both cold and heat) on the catla NOD2 gene expression was clearly different from other tested PRRs. As compared to the control (25 °C), NOD2 was significantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated during thermal stress in all tested tissues/organs at 12 h post-exposure (Fig. 3c). With the advancement of temperature from 25 °C, there was gradual increase in NOD2 gene expression in all tested organs/tissues, except in kidney. Among the tissues, highest induction of NOD2 was observed in liver (~9 fold). In gill and kidney, maximum induction of NOD2 was observed at 15 °C (5–7 fold), and it gradually decreased with the lowering of temperature to 10 °C. In blood, we noticed steady increase in NOD2 expression following cold and heat stress. At 7 days post-exposure, liver, kidney and blood of treated fish group also revealed enhanced NOD2 gene expression (Fig. 3d). Among the tissues, maximum induction of NOD2 was in kidney: at 20 °C it was ~6 fold, at 15 °C ~2.8 fold, at 35 °C ~3.5 fold and at 30 °C it was ~3 fold as compared to the control. In liver, highest expression of NOD2 was at 15 °C (~2.4 fold) and in blood at 35 °C (~2.9 fold).

In addition to PAMPs recognition, the response of NOD receptors in recognizing endogenous ligands (DAMPs) was reported during tissue injury (Ting et al. 2008; Tschopp and Schroder 2010). In fish, the response of NOD receptors in PAMPs recognition and innate immunity was previously been reported in rohu, catla and mrigal (Swain et al. 2012, 2013a, b). In thermal stress, the activation of NOD1 and NOD2 gene in some of the tissues of catla supports the previous observation of DAMPs recognition by NOD receptors, and warrant further study in this regard.

Modulation of TLR and NOD receptor associated downstream signaling molecules
Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88
MyD88 is the downstream adaptor molecule in TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5-signaling pathway. At 12 h post-cold stress and heat stress, MyD88 gene expression in the treated fish gill increased ~2 fold as compared to the control. In the treated fish liver, there was ~5 fold increase in MyD88 expression at 10 °C. At 15 and 35 °C, MyD88 expression was almost equal to the control and at 20° and 30 °C, it was down-regulated. In kidney, except at 10 °C, there was inductive expression of MyD88 gene (2–3 fold), and it reached maximum of ~3 fold at 15 and 30 °C. In blood, there was ~2 fold increase in MyD88 expression only at 10 °C (Fig. 4a). At 7 days post-treatment, MyD88 gene expression increased significantly in gill and liver of the treated fish group as compared to control, and it reached its peak (~3 fold) at 30 °C. In kidney, MyD88 remained almost unchanged at 20, 30 and 35 °C but it was down-regulated at 15 °C. In blood, there was up-regulation of MyD88 at 20 °C, and at other temperatures it remained almost unchanged (Fig. 4b).Fig. 4 MyD88 and RICK gene expression in thermal stress. Total RNA was extracted from gill, liver, kidney and blood from the control and treated fish at 12 h and 7 days post-exposure, and quantitative real-time PCR was conducted to analyze MyD88 and RICK gene expression keeping β-actin as housekeeping control gene. The results were calculated as mean ± standard error (bars in the graph) and were shown as fold changes compared to control. Significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and treated fish group was indicated with asterisks. MyD88 gene expression at 12 h (a) and 7 days (b); RICK gene expression at 12 h (c) and 7 days (d)



In MyD88-dependent TLR-signaling pathway, recognition of PAMP or DAMPs by TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 leads to the activation of downstream adaptor molecule “MyD88” resulting in NF-κB phosphorylation, and induction of cytokines gene expression (Akira 2009). In this study, up-regulation of either TLR2/TLR4/TLR5 genes expression in some tissues correlated with MyD88 gene expression during cold and heat shock, suggesting the activation of MyD88-dependent TLR-signaling pathway. Previously, MyD88 activation in PAMPs mediated TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 signaling resulted in the induction of cytokines in rohu (Samanta et al. 2012) and mrigal (Basu et al. 2012a, b, 2013). Catla, a member of the Indian major carps (IMC), is closely related to rohu and mrigal under the same family of Cyprinidae. Therefore, activation of MyD88 in DAMP mediated TLR signaling during cold and heat stresses may follow a similar pathway of NF-κB phosphorylation and cytokine gene expression.

Receptor interacting serine-threonine protein kinase-2 (RICK)
In NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathway, RICK functions as downstream adaptor molecule. We investigated RICK gene expression in gill, liver, kidney and blood of control and thermal stressed fish through qRT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4c, there was significant induction of RICK gene expression at 12 h post-treatment in all tested tissues. Due to cold stress, highest induction of RICK was observed at 10 °C in blood, followed by liver, kidney and gill in the treated fish group as compared to the control. During heat stress all other tissues except liver revealed marked increase in RICK gene expression. At 7 days post-treatment, RICK gene expression in liver, kidney and blood of the treated fish group followed almost similar pattern as observed in 12 h post-treatment. However, the magnitude of RICK induction at 7 days was much lower than 12 h (Fig. 4c).

NOD1 and NOD2 are cytoplasmic sensors of PAMP/DAMPs and they transmit downstream signaling through RICK. In rohu, catla and mrigal, activation of NOD1, NOD2 and RICK gene expression was previously been reported following PAMPs (iE-DAP, LPS and poly I:C) stimulation and bacterial infection (Swain et al. 2012, 2013a, b). In cold and heat stresses, we also noted significant up-regulation of NOD1 and NOD2 and RICK gene expression in various tissues, which may suggest the activation of NOD signaling pathway by the endogenous ligands during thermal stress in catla.

Conclusion
This article demonstrates TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, NOD1 and NOD2 gene expression in catla fish during the early developmental stages, and this is the first report. The inductive expression of TLR and NOD receptor genes along with their downstream molecules MyD88 and RICK, respectively, suggests the release of DAMPs during thermal stress in fish. The data in this study may help in investigating the greater role of TLR and NOD receptors in repairing the damage tissues and pathology of fish.

In the present study, we have reported a green method for synthesis of SNPs from aqueous stem bark extract of Syzygium alternifolium, an endemic medicinal plant of South Eastern Ghats. These green-synthesised nanoparticles are characterised by colour change pattern, and the broad peak obtained at 448 nm with UV–Vis surface plasmon resonance studies confirm that the synthesised nanoparticles are SNPs. FT-IR spectroscopic studies confirm that phenols and proteins of stem bark extract is mainly responsible for capping and stabilisation of synthesised SNPs. Crystallographic studies from XRD indicates, the SNPs are crystalline in nature owing to 44 nm size. EDAX analysis shows 19.28 weight percentage of Ag metal in the sample indicates the purity of sample. AFM, SEM and TEM microscopic studies reveal that the nanoparticles are spherical in shape with sizes ranging from 4 to 48 nm. Antimicrobial studies of the synthesised SNPs on clinically isolated microbes showed very toxic effects. It indicates that stem bark extract of S. alternifolium is suitable for synthesising stable silver nanoparticles which act as excellent antimicrobial agents.

Introduction
Nanotechnology is one of the most fascinating research areas in modern material science. Nanoparticles are gaining importance in the fields of biology, medicine and electronics owing to their unique physical and biological properties (Morones et al. 2005). Recent studies are focused towards synthesis of nanoparticles using plant materials like, iron, copper, calcium, gold, palladium, zinc and silver. Silver has been recognised of its importance in chemistry, physics and biology due to its unique properties. Conventional methods to synthesise silver nanoparticles are mainly by different chemical, physical and microbial approaches. The most common approach for synthesis of SNPs in chemical approach is by the use of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and citrate as reducing agents. Topical exposure of NaBH4 severely irritates skin and eye, breathing NaBH4 irritates nose and throat, higher exposures can cause pulmonary edema, and very higher exposure may affect nervous system. Citrate causes hypocalcaemia, fatigue, paresthesia and muscle spasms. Common methods for the synthesis of SNPs by physical approach are laser ablation and evaporation/condensation methods. Evaporation/condensation method which could be carried out by using a tube furnace at atmospheric pressure has some disadvantages: occupies large space and consumes a great amount of power. Laser ablation method is also not a cost effective method. These chemical and physical approaches are complicated, expensive and cause potential environmental and biological hazards. In recent times, 50–120 nm-sized silver nanoparticles are synthesised from Bacillus species which acts as a good reducing agent (Vithiyav et al. 2014) but, a significant drawback of microbe-mediated synthesis is that it is not industrially feasible due to its lab maintenance. Therefore, the biosynthesis of SNPs using plant materials is easy, efficient and eco-friendly in comparison to chemical-mediated or microbe-mediated synthesis of SNPs (Anamika et al. 2012). Silver has long been known to have strong inhibitory and bactericidal effects as well as broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity even at low concentrations (Morones et al. 2005). Hence, among the metal nanoparticles, SNPs synthesised from medicinal plants have received much attention for their various biological properties such as anthelmintic (Seema and Amrish 2012), antilarvicidic (Sundaravadivelan et al. 2013), antioxidant (Kumara Swamy et al. 2014), anticancer (Vasanth et al. 2014), anti-inflammatory (Rafie and Hamed 2014), hepatoprotective (Bhuvaneswari et al. 2014), wound healing (Seema et al. 2014) and antimicrobial (Marutikesavakumar et al. 2014).

S. alternifolium belongs to the family Myrtaceae, locally known as mogi or adavineredu. It occurs in the upper plateau, slopes and valley tops with dry, slate and rocky conditions at an elevation ranging from 600 to 1000 m in Sri Venkateswara Wildlife Sanctuary of Chittoor and Cuddapah Districts of Eastern Ghats, Andhra Pradesh, India (Mohan and Lakshmi 2000). Andhra Pradesh State Biodiversity Board (Biodiversity News 2009) documented that the S. alternifolium is an endemic and globally endangered species as per the criteria of IUCN-CAMP to this area. Chloroform and methanolic root extract of S. alternifolium has analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity (Vasu et al. 2012). Leaf juice and pulp of the tender shoots are used to treat bacillary dysentery. Leaves fried in cow ghee are used as a curry to treat dry cough (Rao 2004). Some of the researchers have scientifically proven that leaves have antimicrobial activity (Raju et al. 2007), hypoglycemic and anti-hyperglycemic activity (Ramamohan et al. 2010), antioxidant (Sreelathadevi et al. 2013) and anticancer activity (Komuraiah et al. 2014). Yanadi tribe and local villagers of Veyilingalakona sacred grove and Chenchu and Nakkala tribes of Japali hanuman theertham make fruits into fine powder to treat diarrhoea (Savithramma et al. 2014a) and diabetes (Savithramma et al. 2014b), respectively. Stem bark extract used to treat gastric ulcers (Bakshu 2002), possess antiseptic properties (Rao 2004), to treat external wounds (Karuppusamy et al. 2009) and to regulate blood sugar levels (Sudhakar et al. 2012). In recent studies, synthesis of SNPs was carried out from endemic medicinal plants like Pterocarpus santalinus (Gopinath et al. 2013), Boswellia ovalifoliolata (Ankanna et al. 2010) and Shorea tumbuggaia (Venkateswarlu et al. 2010) which are very rich source of phenols and proteins and act as a good source towards the reduction of silver nanoparticles. There is no report on synthesis of SNPs from S. alternifolium stem bark so far. Hence the present study is undertaken to synthesise stable silver nanoparticles from stem bark extract of S. alternifolium and test their antimicrobial potentialities after characterization using advanced tools.

Materials and methods
Synthesis of silver nanoparticles
S. alternifolium stem bark was collected from Nagatheertham area of Tirumala, Chittoor District of Andhra Pradesh, India and cross checked by herbarium deposited (Voucher no. 121) in Dept. of Botany, Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati. Finely ground 25 g of powdered stem bark was extracted with 100 ml of milli-Q water in a boiling water bath for 1 h. Filter the content with whatman no.1 filter paper and store at room temperature for green synthesis of SNPs. From this 5 ml of plant extract with 50 ml of 1 mM Ag(NO3)2 is titrated at 60–80 °C for 1 h. The contents are centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min to avoid the presence of any biological impurities. Further, it was used for characterization and antimicrobial studies.

Characterization of silver nanoparticles
UV–Vis absorption spectrum of SNPs was measured using Spectro UV 2080 Double beam 1200 l/mm spectrophotometer. Fourier-Transform Infra Red (FT-IR) spectra of synthesised SNPs were analysed in the range of 4,000 to 500 cm−1 with an ALPHA interferometer (ECO-ATR), Bruker, Ettlingen, Karlsruhe, Germany by KBr pellet method. Crystalline nature of metallic silver nanoparticles was examined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) from Shimadzu, XRD-6000 equipped with Cu Kα radiation source using Ni as filter at a setting of 30 kV/30 mA. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis was carried out by using NOVA NT-MDT SOLVER NEXT, RUSSIA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Percentage presence of silver ions in synthesised sample was done by using a FEI Quanta 200 FEG HR-SEM machine equipped with EDAX instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed by using HF-3300 advanced 300 kV TEM/STEM from Hitachi.

Antimicrobial studies of silver nanoparticles
The extracts of synthesised SNPs from stem bark of S. alternifolium was analysed for antimicrobial activity against two gram positive bacterial strains like Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and five Gram negative bacterial strains like Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. Antifungal studies were also carried out on selective five fungal strains like Alternaria solani, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium chrysogenum and Trichoderma harzianum procured from Dept. of Microbiology, Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati. Disc diffusion assay method was followed using standard protocol (Cruickshank 1986). For this 20 µl of 50 µg/ml concentration of plant extract, synthesised SNPs, streptomycin/fluconazole and 1 mM concentration of Ag(NO3)2 solution are applied on separate filter paper discs (Whatman No. 1 filter paper with 7 mm diameter) and allowed to dry before being placed on the agar medium. Triplicates of each extract was tested and incubated at 37  °C for 24 h. in incubation chamber. Diameter of the zones was measured in centimetres (cm) with the help of scale and the results were tabulated.

Results and discussion
When the aqueous stem bark extract of S. alternifolium was mixed with 1 mM Ag(NO3)2 solution, the colour changed from brown to grey which is the primary method to confirm that the synthesised nanoparticles are silver (Fig. 1). The colour change is due to the reduction of silver ions with the help of bio molecules present in the sample (Sankar et al. 2014). NAD and ascorbic acid present at higher levels in all plant parts act as strong reducing agents by donating electrons to Ag+ ions and reduced to form Ag0 nanoparticles (Ahmad et al. 2011). This may be the main reason behind the reduction and colour change pattern of SNPs. Reduction of these silver ions was monitored by using UV–Vis spectroscopy from 190 to 750 nm scan range. The peak obtained at 448 nm is a typical absorption peak for metallic nanoparticles which further confirms the reduced nanoparticles are silver (Fig. 2). Same type of results was found in leaf-mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles from Albizia adianthifolia (Gengan et al. 2013). Here, the nanoparticles in reaction mixture absorb light at different wavelengths and get excited due to charge density at the interface between conductor and insulator of UV–Vis spectroscope to give a respective peak. This mechanism is known as surface plasmon resonance (SPR). FT-IR spectrum of synthesised SNPs was carried out to know the possible bio-molecules responsible for the capping and stabilisation of nanoparticles. For this, the sample was analysed in the scan range from 4000 to 500 cm−1 of near IR spectra by FT-IR. The broad peaks obtained at 3323 cm−1 and 1636 cm−1 were assigned for O–H bond of phenols and N–H bond of primary amines, respectively(Fig. 3). This suggests that the hydroxyl groups of phenols and amide groups of proteins forming a layer of the nanoparticles, act as capping agents to prevent agglomeration and provide stability to the reaction medium. Same type of results was found in Myristica fragrans seed extract-mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Sharma et al. 2014).Fig. 1 Colour change pattern of synthesised SNPs: a

X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out to confirm the nature of nanoparticles. The XRD pattern shows four peaks on 2θ° of X-axis like 38.40°, 46.20°, 64.50° and 77.30° corresponding to 111, 200, 220 and 311 Bragg reflections of Y-axis, respectively (Fig. 4). These Bragg reflections confirm the face-centred cubic structure of SNPs and it coincides with powder diffraction file of International Centre for Diffraction Data (No. 04-07830) and has 44 nm size of SNPs calculated according to Debye–Scherrer equation ((D = kλ/β cos θ). AFM was used as a primary method to monitor the dissolution and agglomeration pattern of surface topology of nanoparticles. The 2 µm resolution studies of AFM reveal that the particles are spherical in shape, with size ranging from 39 to 48 nm (Fig. 5a). Raw data obtained from AFM microscope are treated with specially designed image processing software (NOVA-TX) to further exploit the 3D image of the nanoparticles (Fig. 5b). 500 nm resolution studies of synthesised SNPs with SEM analysis show that the particles are polydispersed, with size ranging from 19 to 26 nm, owing to spherical shape without any agglomeration (Fig. 6a). The EDAX analysis of synthesised sample shows 19.28 weight percentage of Ag metal along with 15.18 % of carbon, 03.64 % of nitrogen, 07.58 % of oxygen, 04.24 % of sodium, 01.75 %of magnesium, 0.70 % of aluminium, 24.60 % of silicon, 18.15 % of aurum and 04.87 % of calcium. 19.28 % of silver indicates the sample having high purity of silver nanoparticles (Table 1; Fig. 6b). A higher magnification study was carried out with TEM analysis to know the size and shape of the nanoparticles along with crystalline nature. 10 nm resolution studies of synthesised SNPs show 4–7 nm size with spherical shape and they do not have any agglomeration (Fig. 7a). Crystallographic nature of SNPs by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shows fringe array of spots corresponding to 111, 200, 220 and 311 (Fig. 7b). The Bragg reflections of XRD pattern is correlated with this SAED pattern of SNPs, which clearly indicates that the nanoparticles are crystalline in nature with face-centred cubic structures. AFM, SEM and TEM microscopic studies of green-synthesised nanoparticles from S. alternifolium show polydispersed 4–48 nm sized spherical-shaped particles.Fig. 4 XRD crystallographic studies of synthesised SNPs show four intensive peaks with 44 nm size

Antimicrobial activity of green synthesised SNPs are analysed on two gram negative and five gram positive bacterial strains growing on nutrient agar medium and five fungal strains growing on potato dextrose agar medium. The inhibition zone of each extract is compared with standard drugs like streptomycin for bacteria and fluconazole for fungi. These SNPs show highest inhibitory activity on S. typhimurium followed by P. vulgaris, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and B. subtilis (Figs. 8; Table 2; Fig. 9). Whereas in the case of fungi, highest inhibition zones are observed in A. flavus followed by P. chrysogenum, T. harzianum, A. solani and A. niger (Figs. 8; Table 3; Fig. 10). Based on these studies 4–48 nm size spherical-shaped nanoparticles show higher toxicity towards clinically isolated microorganisms when compared with Ag(NO3)2 solution as negative control. Spherical-shaped SNPs, 20–60 nm in size, synthesised from stem bark of Syzygium cumini show good antibacterial activity (Prasad and Swamy 2013). Spherical shaped SNPs, 20–35 nm in size, synthesised from Cochlospermum religiosum stem bark show significant antimicrobial activity on different bacterial and fungal pathogens (Sasikala et al. 2014). In our study, gram negative bacteria shows more susceptibility towards SNPs when compared to Gram positive bacteria. The Gram positive bacteria having thick layers of peptidoglycans (together with polypeptide contains proteins) and penetration of SNPs through cell membrane are not that much of easy when compared to gram negative bacteria. The results revealed that the bacterial strains show higher susceptibility to SNPs when compared to fungal strains. Because the fungal cell walls are made up of chitin (a protein polymer) having parallel strands of glucosamines linked with β, 1–4 linkages and cross-linked with hydrogen bonds. Whereas in the case of bacteria, the cell walls are made up of peptidoglycan (a carbohydrate polymer) linked by amino acids and cross-linked by tetrapeptides. Hence the bacterial cell walls are more flexible and elastic, whereas fungal cell walls are somewhat rigid than the bacterial cell walls. Due to this, penetration of SNPs through rigid fungal cell walls is somewhat difficult when compared to bacterial cell walls. Silver is a precious metal used as an effective antimicrobial agent before the advent of silver nanoparticles. The overuse of silver agents has decreased the efficiency of silver agents as an antibiotic. In the recent times, the advancement of nanotechnology has rekindled the interest in the use of silver nanoparticles as antibacterial agents (Wong and Liu 2010). SNPs may attach to the cell membrane surface of pathogens, disturb their permeability and cause structural changes in bacteria (Sondi and Sondi 2004) and destruct the membrane integrity in fungal spores (Krishnaraj et al. 2012), eventually leading to cell death. Some scientists state that the SNPs penetrate inside the bacteria and fungi and cause damage by interacting with the electron phosphorous and sulphur containing compounds such as DNA and proteins, resulting in cell death (Baker et al. 2005). Small size, spherical shape and high surface area to volume ratio to interact with cell walls of pathogens gives them better antimicrobial activity (Agnihotri et al. 2014). The present study also clearly reveals that the particle size ranging from 4 to 48 nm with spherical shape proves high potential microbial activity.Fig. 8 Antimicrobial activity of green synthesised silver nanoparticles from stem bark extract of S. alternifolium: a

Conclusion
The present study is aimed to develop a fast, eco-friendly and cost effective method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles from S. alternifolium. Due to significant drawbacks with physical, chemical- and microbe-mediated methods of silver nanoparticles, green synthesis is the best method. These green-synthesised SNPs are polydispersed, without any agglomeration and have sizes ranging from 4 to 48 nm with spherical shape show broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against different clinically isolated bacteria and fungi by acting as a potential antimicrobial agent. High amount of small-sized nanoparticles produced with little amount of plant extract is beneficial because it is an endemic and endangered medicinal plant. Based on these results, we conclude that S. alternifolium stem bark is an efficient and effective source for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles.

In the present study, prediction and modeling of T-cell epitopes of Nipah virus antigenic proteins nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, glycoprotein, L protein, W protein, V protein and C protein followed by the binding simulation studies of predicted highest binding scorers with their corresponding MHC class I alleles were done. Immunoinformatic tool ProPred1 was used to predict the promiscuous MHC class I epitopes of viral antigenic proteins. The molecular modelings of the epitopes were done by PEPstr server. And alleles structure were predicted by MODELLER 9.10. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies were performed through the NAMD graphical user interface embedded in visual molecular dynamics. Epitopes VPATNSPEL, NPTAVPFTL and LLFVFGPNL of Nucleocapsid, V protein and Fusion protein have considerable binding energy and score with HLA-B7, HLA-B*2705 and HLA-A2MHC class I allele, respectively. These three predicted peptides are highly potential to induce T-cell-mediated immune response and are expected to be useful in designing epitope-based vaccines against Nipah virus after further testing by wet laboratory studies.

Introduction
Nipah virus (NiV) was isolated in 1999 and was identified as the etiological agent responsible for an outbreak of severe respiratory disease and fatal encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore in pigs and humans (Chua et al. 1999). During the first NiV outbreak, the virus infected both pigs and humans, in addition to a small number of cats, dogs and horses (Chua et al. 2000; Epstein et al. 2006). NiV, a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, possesses a negative-sense, non-segmented RNA genome that is 18,246 nt (Malaysian isolate) or 18,252 nt (Bangladesh isolate) in length (Harcourt et al. 2005). It has six transcription units that encode six structural proteins, the nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), glycoprotein (G) and polymerase (L). Similar to other paramyxoviruses, the P gene of NiV expresses four proteins, namely P, V, W and C (Harcourt et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2001).

In Bangladesh, 135 probable or confirmed cases of NiV infection in humans were identified from 2001 through 2008; 98 (73 %) were fatal (Luby et al. 2009). Active Nipah virus encephalitis surveillance identified an encephalitis cluster and sporadic cases in Faridpur, Bangladesh, in January 2010. 16 case patients were identified, in which 14 of these patients died (Sazzad et al. 2013).

Vaccination is the most effective of all the medical interventions to save human and animal lives and to increase production (Horzinek 1999; Tang et al. 2012a). Compared to the conventional vaccines, peptide- or epitope-based vaccines are easy to produce, more specific, cost effective, less time consuming and also safe (Kumar et al. 2013). It is well established that T cells play a critical role in inducing cellular immune response against foreign antigens but they recognize antigenic fragments only when they are associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules exposed on surface of all vertebrate cells (Shekhar et al. 2012; Mohabatkar and Mohammadzadegan 2007). Immunoinformatics approach uses computational algorithms to predict potential vaccine candidates or T-cell epitopes. The advantage of a peptide- or epitope-based vaccine is the ability to deliver high doses of the potential immunogen and at a low cost (Von Hoff et al. 2005; Tang et al. 2012b). Viral protein which could act as a vaccine candidate must be surface-exposed, antigenic and responsible for pathogenicity (Cerdino-Tarraga et al. 2003; Verma et al. 2011).

The prediction of promiscuous MHC class I binding peptides was done using a popular immunoinformatic tool ProPred I (Singh and Raghava 2001). It is an online web tool which uses matrix-based method that allows the prediction of MHC-binding sites in an antigenic sequence for MHC class I alleles. It also allows the prediction of the standard proteasome and immunoproteasome cleavage sites in an antigenic sequence. The simultaneous prediction of MHC binders and proteasome cleavage sites in an antigenic sequence leads to the identification of potential T-cell epitopes.

Structure-based modeling of T-cell epitopes
The PEPstr (peptide tertiary structure prediction server) server (Kaur et al. 2007) predicts the tertiary structure of small peptides with sequence length varying between 7 and 25 residues. The prediction strategy is based on the realization that β-turn is an important and consistent feature of small peptides in addition to regular structures. Thus, the methods use both the regular secondary structure information predicted from PSIPRED and β-turns information predicted from BetaTurns. The side-chain angles are placed using standard backbone-dependent rotamer library. The structure is further refined with energy minimization and molecular dynamic simulations using Amber version 6.

Modeling and validation of MHC I alleles
The IMGT/HLA database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/intro.html) (Robinson et al. 2013) currently contains 10,103 allele sequences. In addition to the physical sequences, the database contains detailed information concerning the material from which the sequence was derived and data on the validation of the sequences. The IMGT/HLA database allows you to retrieve information upon a specific HLA allele (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/allele.html) as named in the WHO Nomenclature Committee Reports. 3D structures of alleles were retrieved from IMGT/HLA database. Some of the allele’s structures, which are not presented in IMGT/HLA database, were modeled with the help of MODELLER 9.10. The stereochemical qualities of the alleles were checked by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. 1993).

Molecular docking
Docking of peptides and alleles structure was carried out using AutoDock 4.2 (Goodsell and Olson 1990; Morris et al. 1998). Gasteiger charges were added to the ligand and maximum six numbers of active torsion are given to the lead compound using AutoDock tool (http://autodock.scripps.edu/resources/adt). Kollaman charges and solvation term were added to the protein structure using AutoDock tool. The Grid for docking calculation was centered to cover the protein-binding site residues and accommodate ligand to move freely. During the docking procedure, a Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) was used for flexible ligand rigid protein docking calculation. Docking parameters were as follows: 30 docking trials, population size of 150, maximum number of energy evaluation ranges of 250,000, maximum number of generations is 27,000, mutation rate of 0.02, cross-over rate of 0.8, other docking parameters were set to the software’s default values.

Molecular dynamics simulation of epitope and HLA allele complex
Molecular dynamics simulation was done using the NAMD graphical interface module (James et al. 2005) incorporated visual molecular dynamics (VMD 1.9.2) (Humphrey et al. 1996). A protein structure file (psf) stores structural information of the protein, such as various types of bonding interactions. The psf was created from the initial pdb and topology files. The psfgen package of VMD is used to create this. To create a psf, we will first make a pgn file, which will be the target of psfgen. After running psfgen, two new files were generated protein pdb and protein psf and by accessing PSF and PDB files; NAMD generated the trajectory DCD file. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the complex was completed using rmsd tcl source file from the Tk console and finally rmsd dat was saved and accessed in Microsoft office excel 2007.

Results and discussion
Prediction and analysis of MHC class I binding peptides
The Nucleocapsid peptide VPATNSPEL at position 38–46 showed ProPred score of 1200 with HLA-B7 MHCI allele. The V protein peptide NPTAVPFTL at position 186–194 showed ProPred score of 2000 with the HLA-B*2705 allele. And the fusion protein peptide LLFVFGPNL at position 209–217 showed ProPred score of 2678.131 with the HLA-A2 allele. ProPred scores of peptides with MHC I alleles are shown in Table 1.

Docking energy determination by AutoDock
3-D coordinate files of allele were obtained through IMGT/HLA database or model through MODELLER (Table 2) were validated using PROCHECK tool. After that, binding simulation studies show that nucleocapsid epitope VPATNSPEL with HLA-B7 allele, V protein epitope NPTAVPFTL with HLA-B*2705 allele as well as fusion epitope LLFVFGPNL with HLA-A2 allele formed stable HLA–peptide complexes with the energy minimization values of −5.07, −3.13 and −3.11 kcal/mol, respectively (Table 3). After docking studies, we determined the number of H bonds present in the stable complex formed.Table 2 List of class I MHC alleles considered in this study for prediction of binding peptides

Nipah virus (NiV) was associated with highly lethal febrile encephalitis in humans and a predominantly respiratory disease in pigs. Periodic deadly outbreaks, documentation of person-to-person transmission, and the potential of this virus as an agent of agroterror reinforce the need for effective means of therapy and prevention (Walpita et al. 2011). The current study incorporates immunoinformatics approach for reducing the time consumed in the long array of experiments to avoid hit and trial sets. Walpita et al. (2011) describe the vaccine potential of NiV proteins glycoprotein, fusion and matrix. Sakib et al. (2014) designed epitope-based peptides for the utility of vaccine development by targeting glycoprotein G and envelope protein F of Nipah virus (NiV) that, respectively, facilitates attachment and fusion of NiV with host cells. AutoDock resulted in good binding affinity along with H bonds at default parameters. The molecular dynamics simulation showed that complex formed between a peptide and allele was attaining proper stability by creating a parallelism in RMSD over a time window. The mentioned peptides can be either isolated or formulated for further in vitro and in vivo testings.

Conclusion
The conclusion drawn from the present study is that the three epitopes VPATNSPEL, NPTAVPFTL and LLFVFGPNL of nucleocapsid, V protein and fusion protein, respectively, have considerable binding with HLA-B7, HLA-B*2705 and HLA-A2MHC class I allele and low-energy minimization values providing stability to the peptide–MHC complex. These peptide constructs may further be undergone wet laboratory studies for the development of targeted vaccine against Nipah virus.

Optimisation of hydrolysis conditions for apple pomace hydrolysis using Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L was investigated using 1 L reaction volumes. The effects of temperature, pH, β-glucosidase supplementation and substrate feeding regimes were determined. Hydrolysis at room temperature using an unbuffered system gave optimal performance. Reactors in batch mode resulted in a better performance (4.2 g/L glucose and 16.8 g/L reducing sugar, 75 % yield for both) than fed-batch (3.2 g/L glucose and 14.6 g/L reducing sugar, 65.5 and 73.1 % yield respectively) in 72 h. The addition of Novozyme 188 to the core mixture of Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L resulted in the doubling of glucose released. The main products (yield %) released from apple pomace hydrolysis were galacturonic acid (78 %), glucose (75 %), arabinose (90 %) and galactose (87 %). These products are potential raw materials for biofuel and biorefinery chemical production.

Introduction
Apple pomace is the waste produced from the extraction of juice from apples. Large quantities of waste are produced worldwide every year, with 25–35 % of the 70 million metric tonnes produced ending up as waste (Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations 2012; Gullon et al. 2008), an estimated 17–24 million metric tonnes per year (Van Dyk et al. 2013). In most cases, the pomace is disposed of, which poses major environmental and health problems due to its high moisture content (70–75 %), high chemical oxygen demand (COD, 10,000 mg/L) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) (Bhushan et al. 2008; Capek et al. 1995; Mahmood et al. 2010; Parmar and Rupasinghe 2013). Combining treatment of this waste with production of value-added products can solve disposal problems, while potentially creating additional revenue in the bio-economy.

Apple pomace is lignocellulosic in nature and a rich source of cellulose, pectin and hemicellulose, which can be enzymatically converted to sugar monomers and other value-added products such as acetic acid, galacturonic acid, phenolics, vanillin, etc. (Bhushan et al. 2008; Foyle et al. 2007; Joshi and Attri 2006; Parmar and Rupasinghe 2013; Vendruscolo and Ninow 2014). Enzymatic degradation of lignocellulosic substrates requires a number of enzymes, working in synergy. Cellulose degradation requires cellobiohydrolases, endoglucanases and β-glucosidases. While hemicellulose and the enzymes required for its degradation have been studied, hemicellulose composition can be variable. In the case of apple pomace, the hemicellulose composition has not been studied and therefore it is not clear which enzymes are required. Some authors have indicated that apple pomace contains xylan (Bhushan et al. 2008; Dhillon et al. 2012; Parmar and Rupasinghe 2012), which would indicate a requirement for endoxylanases and β-xylosidases, as well as possible debranching enzymes. However, the xylose found in apple pomace could also be present in the form of xyloglucan or xylogalacturonan. Le Bourvellec et al. (2011) indicated that fucogalactoxyloglucan was the main hemicellulose in apple pomace. This could indicate a requirement for a completely different set of enzymes compared to xylan hydrolysis, for example xyloglucanases.

Apple pomace also contains high levels of pectin. However, studies on pectin degradation in complex substrates have been very limited. Pectin is highly complex and many enzymes have activity on pectin, for example methyl esterase, acetyl esterase, pectate lyase, pectin lyase, endo-polygalacturonase, exo-polygalacturonase, arabinase and galactanase (Van den Brink and de Vries 2011; Voragen et al. 2009). Pectinases usually refer to the enzymes that cleave the backbone to release galacturonic acid, while arabinase and galactanase cleave the neutral side chains in rhamnogalacturonan I into neutral sugars, arabinose and galactose.

Commercially available enzyme cocktails contain multiple enzymes which act on lignocellulose, with different cocktails optimised for different substrates. As there are no ready-made cocktails for apple pomace degradation, we investigated combinations of cocktails which together would contain the enzymes required for its hydrolysis.

Materials and methods
Apple pomace biomass preparation
Golden Delicious apples, obtained from a local supermarket, were cut into small pieces and the juice extracted using a domestic juicer to separate the pomace from the juice. The pomace was then homogenised in a food processor and washed several times with distilled water until no sugars were detected in the wash using the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) assay (Miller 1959). The apple pomace was stored wet at −20 °C. Apple pomace was used at various substrate loadings based on the wet weight, with dry weight equivalent approximately 10 % of the wet weight. The dry weight was determined by freeze-drying the apple pomace. Sodium azide (0.03 % w/v) was used as a microbial preservative in buffers and apple pomace.

Enzymes
Three commercial enzyme preparations were used in this study: Viscozyme L (“Viscozyme”) (an enzyme complex from Aspergillus aculeatus) (Sigma); Celluclast 1.5L (“Celluclast”) (a commercial Trichoderma reesei ATCC cellulase preparation) (Sigma); Biocip Membrane (“Biocip”) (Novozymes, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) and Novozyme 188 (a commercial Aspergillus niger—β-glucosidase preparation). Various stock concentrations were prepared in appropriate buffers depending on the application.

Polysaccharide and lignin composition of apple pomace
The composition of apple pomace was characterised using a modified method by Moxley and Zhang (2007) and Sluiter et al. (2011).

Determination of sugar composition of apple pomace
Freeze-dried and finely ground apple pomace was hydrolysed using 72 % sulphuric acid according to the method by Moxley and Zhang (2007). The 4 and 1 % acid hydrolysate were centrifuged at 13 000× g for 5 min and the supernatant stored in the freezer. The 4 % hydrolysate was used to measure glucose, galactose, fructose and galacturonic acid and the 1 % hydrolysate to measure xylose and arabinose (using specific Megazyme kits and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods). HPLC was carried out using a Shimadzu HPLC (Shimadzu Scientific, Japan) equipped with a Refractive Index detector and Shodex column (8.0 mm ID × 300 mm L, SP-0810, Japan). The mobile phase was deionised water, with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and a column temperature of 80 °C.

Correction coefficients (CR) for each sugar were determined using known samples of each sugar that were treated in the same way as the samples above.

CR = Concentration measured/concentration known.

The concentration (Cs, %) of the sugars in the polysaccharide was calculated as follows: Cs=CiV/CR∗MWp/MWm/Wt∗100 where Ci represents the measured sugar concentration, MWp the molecular weight of hexose or pentose polysaccharides (162.14 or 132.11 g/mol), MWm the molecular weight of monomeric hexose or pentose (180.16 or 150.13 g/mol), Wt the weight of sample and V the volume of hydrolysate (mL).

Determination of acid insoluble lignin
Aliquots of 86 mL of the 4 % sulphuric acid hydrolysed samples were quantitatively transferred into filtering sintered crucibles, porosity 3, using 50 mL of warm deionised water. Filtration was performed and the solid residues were dried at 105 °C for 4 h or until a constant weight was achieved. Samples were then cooled in a desiccator. The weight was recorded (W1). The crucibles were then placed in a muffle furnace at 580 °C for 24 h, cooled in a desiccator and then weighed (W2). The amount of acid insoluble lignin was then calculated (W1–W2).

Enzyme assays
The activity of the enzymes on apple pomace was determined by measuring reducing sugars released (as glucose equivalents) using a modified 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) assay method (Miller 1959). The DNS assay was performed as was described by Beukes et al. (2008). The concentration of reducing sugars released from apple pomace was determined as glucose equivalents using a glucose standard curve. Detection of individual sugars (glucose, xylose, arabinose and galacturonic acid) was performed using commercial kits (Megazyme, Ireland) according to the manufacturer’s instruction manual. Standard curves for each sugar were used to estimate the amount of sugar released.

The glucose and reducing sugar yields (%) from cellulose and total pomace, respectively, were calculated using the following formulas;

Glucose yield (%) = Glucose liberated (g) × 0.9 × 100/Initial cellulose (g)

Reducing sugar yield (%) = reducing sugar liberated (g) × 100/Initial polysaccharides (g)

Calculations were based on dry weight.

Identification of enzyme activities in Viscozyme and Celluclast
The different enzyme activities in Viscozyme and Celluclast were determined using various substrates. Carboxymethyl cellulose was used for endoglucanase activity, birchwood xylan was used for endoxylanase, locust bean gum was used for endomannanase, polygalacturonic acid was used for polygalacturonase and apple pectin was used for pectinase activity. A 2 % (w/v) (0.2 dry weight/v) substrate stock solution in citrate buffer (pH 5.0, 0.05 M) was prepared. An enzyme concentration of 0.304 mg/mL stock solution was prepared for each enzyme in citrate buffer. The assay was performed in triplicate, under standard assay conditions at 37 °C for 30 min. Sugars were quantified using the DNS assay. Activity was estimated using a glucose standard for endoglucanase, a xylose standard curve for endoxylanase and endomannanase, and a galacturonic acid standard curve for polygalacturonase and pectinase. A modified 4-nitrophenol assay (Berghem and Pettersson 1974) was used to determine the activities of the other enzymes.

To determine the optimal ratio for Viscozyme (V) and Celluclast (C), various percentage ratios (in terms of protein) of the enzyme mixtures were assayed, while keeping the total protein concentration in the assay constant at 0.076 mg/mL. The following combinations were assayed: V100: C0; V87.5: C12.5; V75: C25; V62.5: C37.5; V50: C50; V37.5: C62.5; V25: C75; V12.5: C87.5; V0: C100. The assay was performed for 48 h at 37 °C under standard assay conditions. Specific activity was recorded as glucose equivalents (µg/mL/h) per mg protein.

pH and temperature optima and stabilities of enzyme mixtures
The pH optima were determined using 5 % (wet w/v) (0.5 % dry weight/v) apple pomace in 0.05 M universal buffer (boric, acetic and phosphoric acid) (Britton and Robinson 1931) at pH values ranging from pH 3.0–10.0. The temperature optima were determined using 5 % (wet w/v) apple pomace in citrate buffer (pH 5.0, 0.05 M) at temperatures ranging from 20–70 °C. The assays were performed in triplicate under standard assay conditions at 37 °C for 1 h. The final enzyme protein concentrations in the reaction mixture were 0.076 and 0.19 mg/mL for Viscozyme and Celluclast, respectively.

The pH stability of the Viscozyme and Celluclast solutions was determined by pre-incubating the enzyme solution in universal buffer (0.05 M) at pH 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 over a period of 24 h. Aliquots were removed at various time intervals and stored on ice. The standard assay was then performed in triplicate for the different time intervals for each pH. Suitable assay controls at each pH, where enzymes had not been pre-incubated with substrate, were included. The temperature stabilities of the Viscozyme and Celluclast samples were determined by incubating the enzyme solutions at 20, 28, 37 and 50 °C, respectively, over a period of 24 h. Aliquots were removed at various time intervals and stored on ice. The standard assay was then performed in triplicate for the different time intervals for each temperature. pH and temperature stability were also determined for a period of up to 15 days at pH 5.0 and 37 °C. Enzymes were pre-incubated in buffer (pH 5.0) at 37 °C, with aliquots taken at 1, 3, 6, 10 and 15 days, respectively. Enzyme hydrolysis was then performed at 37 °C for 1 h under standard assay conditions. The residual activities for each enzyme, and each pH and temperature, were calculated as a percentage of that of the controls (i.e. no pre-incubation).

Determining the effect of temperature and buffering on apple pomace hydrolysis using a 50:50 combination of Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L
The effect of temperature and pH on the activity of Viscozyme L - Celluclast 1.5L (50:50) (0.5 µL/mL, 0.038 mg/mL) combination was determined using 5 % apple pomace (wet w/v) (0.5 % dry w/v) final concentration and tap water. Three different incubation temperatures were investigated; namely room temperature (which fluctuated between 22 and 26 °C), 28 and 37 °C. The effect of buffering was investigated using tap water, deionised water and citrate buffer (0.05 M, pH 5.0) at 28 °C. The assays were performed in 1 L shake flasks (Labcon, Maraisburg, South Africa) and reactions were carried out for 72 h on a platform shaker at 165 rpm with 15 mL aliquots removed at different times for sugar analysis and pH determination.

Effect of β-glucosidase supplementation
An initial substrate loading of 5 % apple pomace (wet w/v) (0.5 % dry w/v) was used, with fresh substrate (10 % apple pomace, 1 % dry w/v) added at 50 h intervals. One reactor contained only Viscozyme and Celluclast, while the other reactor also included Novozyme 188 (0.025 µL/mL, 0.0012 mg/mL) (10 % protein of Viscozyme and Celluclast).

A comparison between fed-batch and batch reactors at high substrate loadings
A comparison between a fed-batch and a batch process was performed. Apple pomace was added in different ways to reactors, but each reactor had a final substrate concentration of 20 % apple pomace (wet, w/v) (2 % dry w/v). Three reactors were run, one starting with 5 % substrate, then 5 % additions at 6, 24 and 50 h, respectively. The other reactor was started with 10 % substrate, then 5 % additions at 24 and 50 h, respectively, and the last reactor was started with 20 % initial substrate loading with no further substrate additions. Viscozyme and Celluclast (50:50) (0.5 µL/mL, 0.038 mg/mL) were added together with Novozyme 188 (0.05 µL/mL, 0.0024 mg/mL) to all the reactors.

The inhibitory effects of alcohols, sugars and lignin on Viscozyme and Celluclast
The effects of glucose, cellobiose, xylose and xylobiose at concentrations of 0–2 mM, organic acids at 1, 5 and 10 g/L, and metal ions at 10 and 50 mM in citrate buffer (pH 5, 0.05 M) on Viscozyme and Celluclast were determined. Assays were performed under standard conditions with a Viscozyme–Celluclast enzyme combination (50:50) (0.019 mg/mL for each enzyme) and also with individual enzymes for 24 h at 37 °C. An assay control with the enzymes and substrate, without the inhibitor, was also included. The residual activity for each enzyme or combination, at each inhibitor concentration, was then calculated as a percentage of that of the control (i.e. no inhibitor added).

Results and discussion
Celluclast, Viscozyme and Biocip enzyme cocktails were tested in different combinations for activity on apple pomace. Selection was based on reports in the literature that indicated that Celluclast exhibited mainly cellulase activity; Viscozyme hemicellulase, arabinase, β-glucanase, cellulase and xylanase activities and Biocip polygalacturonase and cellulase activities. Combinations of Viscozyme and Biocip, or Celluclast and Biocip displayed a much lower yield of reducing sugars (glucose equivalents) than combinations of Viscozyme and Celluclast (See “Appendix”, Fig. 6). A combination of Viscozyme, Celluclast and Biocip displayed the same yields as the Viscozyme and Celluclast alone. These results indicated that a combination of Viscozyme and Celluclast was the best for the hydrolysis of apple pomace. Therefore, further experiments were performed using Celluclast and Viscozyme. Enzyme assays using different substrates were carried out to determine the enzyme activity profile for Celluclast and Viscozyme which are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Activities of Viscozyme and Celluclast on different substrates

Values are presented as mean values ± SD (n = 3)



Both mixtures contained similar activities, but in Viscozyme activity on pectin and polygalacturonic acid predominated, while Celluclast exhibited higher cellulase and endoxylanase activity. There are only a few reports in literature which indicate the different enzymes which are present in Celluclast, with no studies reporting on the enzyme activities in Viscozyme. Suwannarangsee et al. (2012) identified the proteins in Celluclast using LC/MS/MS and identified two cellobiohydrolases, five endoglucanases, one xyloglucanase, two β-xylosidases and two endoxylanases. However, they did not identify any pectinases and mannanases, which were detected through activity assays in our study, although Kovacs et al. (2009) reported the presence of mannanase and mannosidase activities in Celluclast. Suwannarangsee et al. (2012) were also able to identify the presence of the non-hydrolytic proteins Cip1, Cip2 and swollenin which contribute to hydrolysis but cannot be detected using the sugar assays.

The optimal enzyme ratio for hydrolysis was determined by combining different ratios of Viscozyme and Celluclast, while keeping the total protein concentration in the assay constant. The enzyme ratio that resulted in the highest release of reducing sugars was V50:C50 (925.5 U/mg protein), followed closely by V62.5:C37.5 and V75:C25 with 889.2 and 865.7 U/mg protein, respectively (See “Appendix”, Fig. 7). The enzyme combination of V50:C50 was selected for all subsequent experiments, although the results indicated that sugar release was not very sensitive to the specific ratio of the enzyme mixtures employed.

Apple pomace composition
The composition of apple pomace was determined with respect to the main sugars and lignin. The amount of acid soluble lignin in apple pomace was 19.8 %, which fell in the range reported by other researchers, 15.2–20.4 % (Bhushan et al. 2008; Nawirska and Kwasniewska 2005). With respect to the neutral sugars in apple pomace, glucose concentration was the highest at 22.3 %, followed by arabinose (12.5 %) and galactose (5.1 %). Very little xylose was detected (1.1 %), but our analysis did not identify whether this formed part of xylan or another polysaccharide such as xyloglucan. The amount of glucose, arabinose and galactose obtained were similar to results reported by other researchers (Bhushan et al. 2008; Joshi and Attri 2006; Parmar and Rupasinghe 2013). The remainder (38 %) consisted mainly of galacturonic acid and other components in low concentrations, most likely ferulic acid, extractives, proteins, minerals and other sugars such as rhamnose which was not directly measured in our study. The HLPC method that was used in this study was unable to measure the galacturonic acid content directly, so that the actual percentage galacturonic acid could not be determined. The reported galacturonic acid content of apple pomace in the literature varies widely and we were unable to clarify this further, 49–64 % (Bhushan et al. 2008) and 11.7 % (Nawirska and Kwasniewska 2005). None of the available methods for determination of lignocellulose composition in the literature have been developed for high pectin-containing substrates, making an accurate mass balance and calculation of yields for galacturonic acid difficult. The presence of starch in the apple pomace was also determined. There was no starch detected in the apple pomace.

Effect of temperature and pH (buffering) on apple pomace hydrolysis
Two of the most important reaction conditions for enzyme hydrolysis are temperature and pH. We first determined the temperature and pH optima for Celluclast and Viscozyme on apple pomace as a substrate and found that Celluclast and Viscozyme both displayed a broad pH range (data not shown). Viscozyme displayed optimal activity over a wide pH range of 3.0–6.0, while Celluclast displayed optimal activity over a narrow range of pH of 3.0–4.5. Viscozyme was very stable and had a residual activity of more than 80 % at pH 4.0, pH 5.0 and pH 6.0 after 24 h incubation, which decreased to around 60 % at pH 3.0. Celluclast had a residual activity of more than 80 % at pH 3.0–6.0 after 24 h incubation, with the highest stability observed at pH 4.0. This indicated that the two mixtures will function effectively over a pH range between pH 3.0 and pH 6.0.

The temperature optima for both commercial enzyme preparations were 50 °C (See “Appendix”, Fig. 8). However, Celluclast had a broad temperature range from 25 to 60 °C, while Viscozyme displayed a range of activity from 25 to 55 °C with two peaks at 37 and 50 °C, respectively. High levels of activity were present at the temperatures used in this study. With respect to stability, Viscozyme retained residual activity above 90 % after 24 h incubation at 20, 28 and 37 °C. However, the residual activity decreased to about 60 % at 50 °C. Celluclast maintained residual activity of above 90 % at 20, 28, 37 and 50 °C, with the greatest stability observed at 37 °C. A combination of Viscozyme and Celluclast was more stable than the individual enzyme mixtures and displayed more than 90 % residual activity after 15 days at 37 °C and pH 5.0 (data not shown).

To determine the effect of buffering on apple pomace hydrolysis, the amount of reducing sugars released and the change in pH were measured over a period of 72 h using citrate buffer, tap water and deionised water and different temperatures. The results are shown in Fig. 1. There was a rapid release of reducing sugars during the first 6 h with the unbuffered reactions showing the highest levels, coinciding with a sharp decrease in pH observed during this time (Fig. 1a, b).Fig. 1 Evaluation of the effect of temperature and pH. The amount of reducing sugars released and pH measured at different time intervals using citrate buffer pH 5.0, tap water and deionised water at 28 °C (a, b); and different incubation temperatures using tap water (c and d), respectively. Apple pomace 5 % (wet, w/v) (0.5 % dry w/v) was used as substrate in shake flasks of 1 L reaction volumes and was mixed by shaking on a platform shaker for 72 h. Data points are presented as mean values ± SD (n = 3)



Tap water showed the highest release of reducing sugars (3.54 g/L) followed by deionised water (3.01 g/L) and lastly, citrate buffer (pH 5.0) (2.47 g/L). Citrate buffer maintained the pH around pH 5.0, while in the case of tap water and deionised water, the pH dropped to around pH 3.6 (Fig. 1b). The drop in pH in the unbuffered reactions can be attributed to the release of acids such as galacturonic acid from the pectin component. The higher levels of reducing sugars released in reactions (where the pH displayed a significant decrease) indicated that the multiple enzymes present in the mixture probably displayed activity at different pH values. The change in pH therefore seems to promote the activity of certain enzymes. This seems to be supported by the wide range in pH optima for the mixtures. Achieving the best result without buffering means that the costs associated with adding chemicals are significantly reduced.

The difference in results between tap water and deionised water is difficult to explain. One hypothesis is that the presence of metal ions in tap water that may have a stimulatory effect on the enzymes, e.g. Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+ and K (Ferchak and Pye 1983; Tejirian and Xu 2010). However, when the effect of metal ions was examined on enzyme activity, no enhancement in activity was found (data not shown).

Although the optima for the enzyme mixtures were 50 °C, the aim was to limit the energy and chemical inputs and associated costs and therefore decided to test the rate of hydrolysis at room temperature (no energy input, with fluctuations), 28 °C (minimal energy input but constant temperature) and 37 °C. Our results also indicated that the enzymes displayed greater stability at lower temperatures. Reactions at all three temperature conditions did not display large differences in terms of reducing sugar release and pH (Fig. 1c and d) using an unbuffered system (i.e. tap water). The amount of reducing sugars released after 72 h at room temperature, 28 and 37 °C were 3.3, 3.6 and 3.5 g/L, respectively. Although the reaction at room temperature produced slightly lower amounts of reducing sugars, such conditions could still be effective for bioreactor applications, since no input of energy and cost associated with buffering was required, while still obtaining high levels of sugars. Depending on the value of the products produced in an industrial process, a temperature of 50 °C can still be implemented and reactions can be run for shorter times.

Effect of β-glucosidase supplementation
The effect of supplementing with additional β-glucosidase activity was determined by adding Novozyme 188 to the enzyme mixture at 10 % (protein weight) and comparing it to a reaction without Novozyme 188 supplementation. The initial substrate concentration for both reactors was 5 % and additional 10 % substrate was added every 50 h. The amount of glucose and reducing sugars released are shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2 Evaluation of β-glucosidase supplementation. Concentration of sugars released at different time intervals for the fed-batch reactor mixed with compressed air at room temperature, with (10 %Nov) and without Novozyme 188 supplementation (10 % protein) (a—glucose, b—reducing sugars). Both reactors started with 5 % (wet, w/v) (0.5 % dry w/v) substrate and 10 % substrate (1 % dry w/v) added every 50 h (indicated by arrow). Data points are presented as mean values ± SD (n = 3)



The amount of glucose released from bioreactors with 10 and 10 %Nov substrate loadings after 100 h was 1.8 and 2.9 g/L, respectively, giving overall glucose yields of 69 % (at 50 h) and 45 % (at 100 h) using 10 % substrate loadings without Novozyme addition. The glucose yield was 88 % (50 h) and 70 % (100 h) using 10 % substrate loading and supplementation with Novozyme (10 %Nov). After 200 h, the amount of glucose released with 10 and 10 %Nov increased to 2.1 and 4.7 g/L, respectively (See “Appendix”, Fig. 9). The amount of reducing sugars released from 10 and 10 %Nov bioreactors was 11.2 and 11.3 g/L, respectively, which corresponded to yields of 74.5 % (at 50 h) and 69.4 % (at 100 h) using 10 % substrate loading without Novozyme addition. The reducing sugar yield was 69 % (50 h) and 68 % (100 h) when using 10 % substrate loading with Novozyme supplementation. The amount reducing sugars increased to 21.2 and 23.0 g/L for bioreactors with 10 and 10 %Nov, respectively (See “Appendix”, Fig. 9). β-glucosidase cleaves cellobiose into glucose and can therefore increase the yield of glucose, but, more importantly, prevents end-product inhibition of cellulases by cellobiose (Teeri 1997). Our studies showed significant inhibition of Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L in the presence of cellobiose which indicates that end-product inhibition is an important factor (see Fig. 5), while the increased release of glucose in the presence of Novozyme 188 also confirms that β-glucosidase activity resulted in cleavage of cellobiose. Only a small difference in reducing sugars produced was observed in the two treatments (Fig. 2b) indicating that Novozyme 188 supplementation had no effect on the release of reducing sugars. However, the effect on glucose release became significant after 50 h hydrolysis. This indicated that Novozyme 188 supplementation became significant over longer hydrolysis times and when substrate loading was high.

A comparison between fed-batch and batch reactors at high substrate loadings
Further studies were carried out to compare a fed-batch system with a batch process at a high substrate loading (20 % wet w/v). Three reactors with different substrate feeding regimes were compared and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The final substrate loading for each reactor was 20 %.Fig. 3 Evaluation of different substrate loadings. Concentration of sugars released at different time intervals for the reactor mixed with compressed air at room temperature with different substrate loading regimes. Reactors are identified according to their initial substrate loading (5, 10 and 20 % wet w/v) (0.5, 1 and 2 % dry w/v). a (Glucose), b (glucose yield), c (reducing sugars) and d (reducing sugar yield). Data points are presented as mean values ± SD (n = 3)



The amounts of glucose (% yield) released by the different reactor treatments (5, 10 and 20 % starting substrate concentration) after 100 h were 3.2 (66.1 %), 3.2 (65.5 %) and 4.2 g/L (75 %), respectively (Fig. 3a and b). The bioreactors (5, 10 and 20 % substrate) produced 14 g/L (72.7 %), 14.6 g/L (73.1 %) and 16.8 g/L (75 %) reducing sugars, respectively (Fig. 3c, d). Reactors that started with 5 and 10 % substrate performed almost identically. However, the reactor operated in batch mode, starting with 20 % substrate, produced a higher sugar concentration and yield after 100 h (Fig. 3).

A detailed sugar profile for the batch reaction at 20 % substrate loading is shown in Fig. 4.Fig. 4 Concentration of sugars released at different time intervals for the batch reactor mixed with compressed air at room temperature. The initial substrate loading 20 % (wet, w/v) (2 % dry w/v). Data points are presented as mean values ± SD (n = 3)



Galacturonic acid (6.6 g/L, 78 % yield), followed by glucose (4.2 g/L, 75 % yield), arabinose (3.5 g/L, 90 % yield) and galactose (1.0 g/L, 87 % yield) were the major products released from apple pomace (Fig. 4). Galacturonic acid, from the pectin backbone, and arabinose and galactose, from neutral side chains in pectin, were rapidly released in the first 6 h, as compared to glucose and xylose which showed a slower release and indicated that the enzymes seemed to hydrolyse the pectin component first (Fig. 4). In an unlikely situation for apple pomace, galacturonic acid could also be released from xylan side chain substitution, and arabinose and galactose could also be from xyloglucan and xylan. We did not specifically assay for arabinase and galactanase activity, but it appears that these enzymes were present in the commercial mixtures as Voragen et al. (2009) clearly showed that apples contained high levels of neutral side chains. It is therefore unlikely that the high concentrations of arabinose and galactose were released by the actions of other enzymes, such as α-arabinofuranosidase or α-galactosidase, although such enzymes may have a contribution.

Pectinases, arabinases and galactanases appeared to be more active at the initial stages, modifying and opening up the structure for cellulases to hydrolyse the cellulose component and release glucose. Some studies have indicated that pectin and the neutral side chains in pectin may mask the access of cellulases to their substrate in a similar manner to xylan and that the synergistic action of these enzymes may contribute to the release of glucose (Pakarinen et al. 2012; Spagnuolo et al. 1997; Van Dyk et al. 2013). This will be investigated in future studies.

There seemed to be a direct correlation between the release of galacturonic acid and the decrease in pH, confirming results from Fig. 1. Figure 4 indicated that most of the sugars were released within the first 50 h; therefore, operating the reactors for a shorter time in a batch mode appears to be effective.

The products released from apple pomace can be used for producing value-added commodities or products. The production of multiple sugars and galacturonic acid poses a challenge for bioethanol production as there is not a single organism capable of fermenting all these sugars. Glucose can be fermented to ethanol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis, while arabinose, xylose and galacturonic acid can be fermented using genetically modified organisms, e.g. E. coli K011 and Erwinia species (E. crysanthemi EC16 and E. carotovora SR38) (Dien et al. 2003; Grohmann et al. 1995, 1998; Kang et al. 2014). Galacturonic acid can also be utilised in the synthesis of tensioactive agents for pharmaceutical and cosmetic purposes, as an acid agent, and for the production of vitamin C (Baciu and Jordening 2004; Boluda-Aguilar et al. 2010; Pourbafrani et al. 2010). Arabinose can be used for diagnostics (in bacteriology); derivatised to 5-deoxy-L-arabinose, which has anti-Parkinson properties; and as a precursor of l-fructose and l-glucose that are used as sweeteners (Baciu and Jordening 2004). Xylose and glucose can also be utilised in the food industry in the production of food sweeteners, xylitol and sorbitol, respectively (Bhushan et al. 2008; Demirbas 2008). However, there may be other sugars and products in the hydrolysate that were not measured and these may also add to the value of degraded apple pomace.

Influence of sugars and organic acids on Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L
The effect of sugars on the Viscozyme and Celluclast combination was measured to determine their possible impact on the hydrolysis performance and is displayed in Fig. 5.Fig. 5 Viscozyme and Celluclast (50:50 ratio) residual activity in the presence of different sugars (a); and different organic acids (b). Residual activity was calculated as the activity obtained at each acid concentration divided by activity with no acid included, which was then multiplied by 100. Activity was measured using 5 % (wet w/v) (0.5 % dry w/v) apple pomace as substrate. Data points are presented as mean values ± SD (n = 3)



Hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose results in the production of sugars such as glucose, cellobiose, cello-oligomers, xylose, xylo-oligomers, galactose and arabinose; hence some of these sugars were chosen for this study (Fig. 4). For the Viscozyme:Celluclast (50:50) combination, all the sugars tested displayed a linear trend of inhibition with increased concentrations of the inhibitor, although arabinose and galactose displayed activation at very low concentrations. Cellobiose and xylobiose displayed greater inhibition compared to the monomers glucose, xylose, arabinose and galactose. At high concentrations (2 mM), activity was reduced to ≈40 % in the presence of cellobiose and xylobiose, while activity was about ≈50 % in the presence of glucose and xylose. The sugar concentrations in the bioreactor after 100 h hydrolysis (Fig. 4) were above 2 mM (except for xylose) and therefore are inhibitory to the enzymes slowing down the hydrolysis process. However, these sugars are released gradually in the bioreactor as compared to the initially high amounts for inhibition studies plus additional sugars released during hydrolysis. Using β-glucosidase in 100 h bioreactor experiments, the inhibitory effect of glucose was minimised. In order to avoid inhibitory effect of the sugars on the enzymes during hydrolysis, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) can be implemented (Kang et al. 2014). Membrane bioreactors can also be used (Andric et al. 2010; Baeyens et al. 2015).

Organic acids may be present in a bioreactor for different reasons. They may be produced through a fermentative pathway or through hydrolysis of the substrate—for example galacturonic acid is released from the degradation of apple pomace degradation (Gullon et al. 2008). If SSF and consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) bioreactors is used, then the organic acids released from fermentation can inhibit saccharifying enzymes. The organic acids may also inhibit microbial fermentation by inhibiting their growth and metabolism (e.g. formic acid and acetic acid have been reported to have an inhibitory effect on microbial fermentation) (Parmar and Rupasinghe 2012). Butyric, acetic and citric acid only had a slightly inhibitory effect on enzyme activity, with activity remaining above 80 %, even at concentrations of 10 g/L. Activity of 70–80 % was retained at the concentrations of galacturonic acid tested (1–10 g/L). The results observed in Fig. 4, which showed a concentration of 6.6 g/L galacturonic acid released after 100 h hydrolysis, indicated there may have been some enzyme inhibition taking place. However, in enzyme hydrolysis the concentration of galacturonic acid increases gradually as compared to initially high concentrations for inhibition studies. The concentration of galacturonic acid in the inhibition studies increases above the initial concentrations due to extra galacturonic acid released by enzyme action. Malic, formic and lactic acid displayed the greatest inhibitory effect and the enzyme activity decreased to below 50 %, even at low concentrations of the organic acids (1 g/L). However, these acids will affect the hydrolytic enzymes in the bioreactor if SSF is used. Considering these results, separate hydrolysis and fermentation will be more ideal to prevent enzyme inhibition in industrial bioreactors.

Conclusions
The obtained results indicated that hydrolysis of apple pomace using Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L can be successfully performed at room temperature without buffering, therefore lowering the operational costs involved in the treatment of this waste, while producing multiple products that can further contribute in value addition. β-glucosidase supplementation to Viscozyme L and Celluclast 1.5L was very important as it resulted in the doubling of the amount of glucose released over longer periods of incubation. The best results were obtained by operating the bioreactors in a batch mode producing 4.2 g/L glucose and 16.8 g/L reducing sugar (75 % yield for both glucose and reducing sugar) compared to the fed-batch bioreactors. Apple pomace hydrolysis products such as glucose, galacturonic acid, arabinose and galactose (75, 78, 90, and 87 % yield, respectively) can be further explored for value addition, making the treatment process more cost-effective. This study revealed that there were multiple and complementary enzymes present in both the Viscozyme and Celluclast cocktails. Employing similar hydrolysis conditions for the enzymes allow for the cost-effective application in industrial bioreactors. The inhibitory effect of various sugars on Viscozyme and Celluclast can be minimised using a SSF or a membrane bioreactor system.

The role of lipids and possible protein–lipids interactions remains a relatively unexplored territory. Investigating the role of potential lipid-binding regions in the sub-units of the mitochondrial motor might help to shed some more light in our understanding of protein–lipid interactions mechanistically. Bioinformatics results seem to indicate multiple potential lipid-binding regions in each of the sub-units. The subsequent characterization of some of those regions in silico provides insight into the mechanistic functioning of this intriguing and essential part of the protein translocation machinery. Details about the way the regions interact with phospholipids were found by the use of Monte Carlo simulations. For example, Pam18 contains one possible transmembrane region and two tilted surface bound conformations upon interaction with phospholipids. The results demonstrate that the presented bioinformatics approach might be useful in an attempt to expand the knowledge of the possible role of protein–lipid interactions in the mitochondrial protein translocation process.

Introduction
Over the last three decades, multiple types of translocation machineries have been identified in cells (Bohnsack and Schleiff 2010). A motor protein or motor protein machine seems to play a central role in each of those translocation systems. For example in the Sec machinery, the system that facilitates the translocation across and into the prokaryotic membrane is SecA (Vrontou and Economou 2004). While across an endoplasmic reticulum membrane and a mitochondrial membrane, the identified motor proteins are BiP and mtHsp70, respectively (Tomkiewicz et al. 2007). There are, however, important differences in the way of operation. In the Sec system, the motor function is performed by one protein, i.e., SecA (Papanikolau et al. 2007) while in the mitochondrial protein import machinery mtHsp70 is one of the subunits of the matrix import motor (Kang et al. 1990). The identification of other sub-units like Pam18 (D’Silva et al. 2003; Mokranjac et al. 2003; Truscott et al. 2003) substantially increased the understanding of the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Recently, new interesting details have been identified regarding the dynamic exchange of Pam18, one of the subunits of the motor-dependent mitochondrial protein translocation, at the motor (Schulz and Rehling 2014).

SecA is one of the best studied proteins in the field of protein translocation. It has not only been identified as a protein that is an essential part of the Sec system (Cabelli et al. 1988) with a well-regulated ATPase activity (Lill et al. 1990) but was also recognized as the protein translocation motor protein in the Sec protein translocation machinery as well (see Vrontou and Economou 2004 for a review). It has been demonstrated that SecA can not only bind but also insert into anionic phospholipid containing membranes (Ulbrandt et al. 1992; Keller et al. 1995). In terms of a mechanistic understanding of these observations, it is interesting to note that a number of possible lipid-binding regions in SecA have been identified (Keller 2011a).

In the same report, multiple lipid-binding regions were found for mtHsp70 (Keller 2011a), a protein with ATPase activity involved in the mitochondrial protein import (Schneider et al. 1996). So at least one component of the protein import motor in the mitochondrial protein translocation machinery exhibits potential lipid-binding regions, just like in SecA (Keller 2011a). Tim44 is a peripheral membrane protein that is able to bind to anionic phospholipids (Weiss et al. 1999). It has been demonstrated that a region in the N-terminal part of the C-terminal domain of this protein is involved in the membrane binding of Tim44 (Marom et al. 2009). Pam18 and Pam16 also known as Tim14 and Tim16 have been studied in great detail (see for example Mokranjac et al. 2006) and it has been suggested that Pam18 contains a transmembrane helix while the closely related Pam16 contains a hydrophobic N-terminus instead. Additionally, a recent report with interesting new details regarding the motor-dependent mitochondrial protein translocation (Schulz and Rehling 2014) triggered the question whether in Pam18 and other subunits of the mitochondrial import motor (novel) helical potential lipid-binding regions can be identified similarly as for mtHsp70. Furthermore, for some of the subunits of the protein import motor, an attempt will be made to give an in-depth in silico characterization of a number of the lipid-binding regions identified. The results will be discussed in terms of the mechanistic implications of our understanding of the functioning of the import motor and the possible role of protein–lipid interactions in this functioning.

Materials and methods
Primary and secondary structure
The primary structure of the investigated proteins was obtained from the Uniprot database or from information in the indicated references. Routinely, the extent of helicity was checked either by possible available data and/or by secondary structure prediction using the program SOPMA (Combet et al. 2000) available at http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/. In this study, additional approaches are used for the sake of comparison; see “Secondary structure prediction, crucial start in the search for lipid-binding regions” in “Results” for additional details.

Determination of lipid-binding potential and Eisenberg plot approach
The main source for the determination of potential lipid-binding regions is the Heliquest software (Gautier et al. 2008); server and additional information are available at the website http://heliquest.ipmc.cnrs.fr/. This was used to obtain data about the mean hydrophobicity (⟨H⟩), the hydrophobic moment (μH) and the net charge (z). For the analysis, 18-residue windows (selecting α-helix) were used unless stated otherwise. The discrimination factor (D) depends on the hydrophobic moment (μH) and the net charge (z) and is defined according to: D = 0.944 (⟨μH⟩) + 0.33 (z). When the calculation results in a discrimination factor above 0.68, then this region can be considered to be a (potential) lipid-binding helix (Gautier et al. 2008). For the Eisenberg plot approach, both the mean hydrophobicity (⟨H⟩) and the hydrophobic moment (μH) were plotted using Heliquest-generated data (see Keller 2011b for further details). Using this approach, the possible surface seeking and transmembrane (TM) helix properties were determined. For the identification of transmembrane regions, a ⟨H⟩ value above 0.75 is used (see Keller 2011b for further details).

Monte Carlo simulations using MCPep
The MCPep server, available at http://bental.tau.ac.il/MCPep/ (Gofman et al. 2012), was used essentially as described before (Keller 2014). The MCPep server used a program implementing a model that allows the performance of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the interaction of helical peptides with lipid bilayers and provides a discrimination between the TM and the surface orientation configurations. A typical analysis (see Gofman et al. 2012 for more details) included the input of the corresponding sequence in FASTA format, a membrane width of 30 Å and an RMSD cutoff of 3 Å. See for details about the used anionic lipid content the “Results” section. The number of independent MC runs (three) and the number of MC cycles in each independent run (500,000) were fixed for each analysis.

Structural modeling
The 3-D structures and corresponding PDB files of a number of proteins studied were generated using I-Tasser (Zhang 2008), available at website http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/. The ProBLM webserver is used (Kimmett et al. 2014), available at http://compbio.clemson.edu/sapp/problm_webserver/. This program makes use of a geometry-based approach that positioned a membrane protein into a pregenerated lipid membrane and allows manual refinement. A lipid bilayer membrane is used that contains phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) lipids. Chimera (Pettersen et al. 2004), available at website http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/, is used to view the created PDB files in this study.

Results
Pam18, an important subunit of the mitochondrial protein motor
Pam18/Tim14 has been identified as an important subunit of the mitochondrial protein motor (see for example Mokranjac et al. 2003). A recent report revealed interesting details of the Pam18 protein in the functioning of the Hsp70 import motor (Schulz and Rehling 2014). Thanks to new developments in bioinformatics approaches, a direct identification of potential helical lipid-binding regions is possible; an important program in this approach is the Heliquest program (Gautier et al. 2008). This program provides data on physical parameters like the mean hydrophobicity (⟨H⟩), the hydrophobic moment (μH) and the net charge (z). With the use of the Heliquest program (Gautier et al. 2008) and the Heliquest-generated Eisenberg plot (Keller 2011b), a number of potential lipid-binding regions can be identified in Pam18/Tim14 (see Table 1). Two novel lipid-binding regions AA 120–137 and AA 151–168 were identified with the so-called lipid-binding discrimination factor D (see Gautier et al. 2008 and the “Materials and methods” section for more details on this); in both cases, the value was above 0.68 (1.59 and 0.78, respectively). An additional lipid-binding region AA 66–83 was identified using the mean hydrophobicity according to the Heliquest-generated Eisenberg plot approach (Keller 2011b) and corresponded to a transmembrane region (Table 1 for further details); the mean hydrophobicity ⟨H⟩ was above 0.75 as the threshold value for a typical transmembrane helix. This latter finding corresponds well with the current notion of the presence of a transmembrane helix in Pam18 (see Mokranjac et al. 2006). The results for Pam18 correlate intriguingly well with the finding that also in the Sec system for the motor protein SecA lipid-binding regions were identified with the use of the Heliquest program (Keller 2011a). Furthermore, it is interesting to note that for SecG, a membrane protein involved in the SecYEG complex of the Sec system, a lipid-binding region, was found with the Heliquest program as well as a transmembrane helix as identified with the Heliquest-generated Eisenberg approach (Keller 2013) in a way that resembles that of Pam18. It is tempting to speculate that the reported SecG inversion during protein translocation (Morita et al. 2012) might give a mechanistic explanation for the involvement of Pam18 in the motor functioning of the mitochondrial protein import motor. The results as depicted in Table 1 are predictions, as discussed previously (see Keller 2011b). The confidence for correctly predicting lipid-binding regions is more than 90 %. This accuracy is based on comparison of predictions with well-known and well-described experimental data (see also Gautier et al. 2008 and Keller 2014). It has to be noted that most of the time only novel lipid-binding regions can be expected by the use of the lipid-binding discrimination factor as determined by Heliquest; the possible presence of TM helices as determined by the use of the Heliquest-based Eisenberg plot approach is one of the many ways to identify TM helices. It has been shown, however, that this approach is quite accurate as well (see Keller 2013).Table 1 The lipid-binding region (LBR) search of the subunits of the mitochondrial protein translocation motor

The prediction (and in this case a positive identification of an LBR) is based on either the Heliquest lipid-binding discrimination factor (D) or the Heliquest data-generated Eisenberg plot approach to determine the presence of a possible surface seeking helix (S) or transmembrane helix (TM)


aAccording to the Heliquest data-generated Eisenberg plot approach, these indicated regions are in close vicinity of the areas of a surface seeking or transmembrane protein



Pam16, a closely related subunit of the mitochondrial import motor
The protein import motor in mitochondrial protein translocation is a proteinaceous complex with multiple subunits. Pam16 is another subunit of the heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70)-based import motor (Frazier et al. 2004). Currently, it is believed that Pam18 and Pam16 form a heterodimer and their interaction plays a critical role in the functioning of the import motor (Pais et al. 2011). Just as in Pam18, two novel lipid-binding regions AA 92–109 and AA 107–124 were identified (see Table 1 for details). The lipid-binding discrimination factor D was found in both cases to be above 0.68 (1.23 and 1.41, respectively). An additional lipid-binding region AA 5–22 was identified and, according to the mean hydrophobicity found (⟨H⟩ = 0.735) which is close to the threshold value of 0.75, corresponded possibly to a transmembrane helix region. This corresponds well with the earlier described findings that Pam16 contains no TM helix but a hydrophobic region instead (Mokranjac et al. 2006). This issue is analyzed further using other bioinformatics tools and discussed later on, see “Some additional characterizations of lipid-binding regions of other subunits” in “Results” and supplementary materials Fig. S2 for helical wheel plots.

Pam17, another membrane-associated subunit of the import motor
Pam17 is one of the membrane-associated co-chaperones. It interacts with the channel protein Tim23 and thus forms an interaction site between Tim23 and the mitochondrial protein import motor (Hutu et al. 2008). As in Pam16 and Pam18, a number of novel potential helical lipid-binding regions AA 4–21, AA 112–129 and AA 163–180 were identified with the lipid discrimination factor D; in all those cases, the value was above 0.68 (0.75, 1.14 and 1.82, respectively) (see Table 1 for details). Additionally, two lipid-binding regions AA 52–69 and AA 87–104 were identified and according to their mean hydrophobicity (⟨H⟩ = 0.791 and 0.861, respectively), they clearly correspond to a transmembrane region according to the threshold value of 0.75 as used in the Heliquest-generated Eisenberg plot approach (Keller 2011b). This corresponds well with earlier findings (Maarse et al. 1994). These two regions will be analyzed and discussed further later on this section. See supplementary materials Fig. S2 for helical wheel plots.

Tim 44, the adaptor protein of the mitochondrial protein import motor
It was found that an efficient interaction of Tim44 with mtHsp70 is necessary for a proper functioning of the mitochondrial protein import motor (Merlin et al. 1999). Numerous lipid-binding regions were found for Tim44 (see Table 1 for details). Only one region AA 301–318 might, according to the Heliquest-generated Eisenberg plot analysis, be classified as a ‘classical’ surface seeking helix. The mean hydrophobicity ⟨H⟩ and the hydrophobic moment ⟨μH⟩ (0.487 and 0.550, respectively) put this region very close to the surface seeking area in the Heliquest-generated Eisenberg plot, which is defined as positions above the following line ⟨μH⟩ = 0.645 − 0.324 ⟨H⟩ (see Keller 2011b for further details). This region will be analyzed and discussed further later on in this section. See supplementary materials Fig. S2 for helical wheel plots. All other regions fall into the globular protein region of the hydrophobic moment plot and might indicate that Tim44 according to these characteristics be a member of the amphitropic protein family (Keller 2014). Indeed, this corresponds nicely with the earlier suggestion that Tim44 is a peripheral membrane protein (Weiss et al. 1999). Region AA 226–243 corresponds nicely with one of the earlier identified lipid regions, the so-called A1 helix of Tim44 (Marom et al. 2009). The A2 helix as described in the same paper seems to be missed by the Heliquest-based lipid-binding region search approach. However, as discussed previously (Keller 2014) occasionally matters like charge neutralization might be involved. Indeed if one of the, for example, glutamic acids in this region is neutralized upon binding to negatively charged phospholipids, this region can act as a potential helical lipid-binding region. All other regions as identified here are novel, as indicated before (Marom et al. 2009); the existence of other regions besides the A1 and A2 helix involved in lipid binding could not be excluded and might be identified in the present study.

Secondary structure prediction, crucial start in the search for lipid-binding regions
The identification of lipid-binding regions is focused on the helical parts of proteins like the Pam18. This is important because the prerequisite of the (manual) use of Heliquest is that the region must be helical. The first step in the search for possible lipid-binding regions involves a secondary structure analysis using prediction programs such as SOPMA (Combet et al. 2000) as used in previous studies routinely (see for example Keller 2014). In Table 2, a comparison of the secondary structure analysis is made between different approaches. It is clear that overall a method like PSIPRED (McGuffin et al. 2000) available at http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/ gave comparable results to SOPMA. The same is true for another frequently used prediction method JPred3 (Cole et al. 2008) available at http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-jpred/. Interestingly, I-TASSER (Zhang 2008) available at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/, a bioinformatics method that predicts 3D structures of protein molecules from their primary sequence and generates secondary structure predictions as well, gives very similar results. One of the most recent protein secondary structure prediction methods is CONCORD (Wei et al. 2012) available at http://helios.princeton.edu/CONCORD, a method based on a mixed integer linear optimization of seven secondary structure prediction methods. This method was performed in a comparable way to the single methods. The paper describing the CONCORD method goes into the performance and accuracy in great detail (Wei et al. 2012) and together with the excellent discussion by Rost (2001) it has been indicated that every individual method for protein secondary structure prediction has a theoretical limit of 88 % accuracy. Although the results in Table 2 can only be used for indicative purposes when it comes to a comparison of the performance of the different methods, it is clear that the overall results justify the conclusion that the identified potential lipid-binding regions are most likely helical. As indicated above, SOPMA is used in earlier studies (see for example Keller 2011a). It is a straight forward, fast and easy to use approach with overall reliable results. The Heliquest approach requires sufficient helical content of the region of interest but allows a wide range; in other words, it is not extremely important to know whether the helical content is 60 or 89 %. However, the result of Tim14 region AA 66–83 demonstrates the potential danger that you can miss a region because of a (too) low helical content based on one single prediction method. The results in Table 2 seem to indicate that at least two different methods need to be used to minimize incidental misinterpretation. Based on the results and (earlier) experiences with the methods used, SOPMA and CONCORD are good candidates.Table 2 Comparison of different secondary structure prediction methods with the method used routinely in this study SOPMA

Further characterization of the lipid-binding regions of Pam18
The only crystal structure of Pam18/Tim14 determined using X-ray diffraction (deposited with PDB entry 2GUZ) is unfortunately based on the AA 99–168 fragment of the protein, including the so-called J-domain (region AA 112–168) but lacking the transmembrane helix (Mokranjac et al. 2006); see Fig. 1a. To get an idea how the complete protein looks like, the whole sequence is analyzed using the program I-TASSER (see Fig. 1b). The part that corresponds to the AA 99–168 fragment (Fig. 1b) looks similar to that reported before (Mokranjac et al. 2006), which is no real surprise since the MC approach used by the I-TASSER program makes use of the PDB entry 2GUZ. It is clear that in the absence of lipids or even detergents, it is hard to estimate how meaningful in this model the position of the transmembrane helix really is. To get some idea about this, the new ProBLM webserver is used (Kimmett et al. 2014). This new program makes use of a geometry-based approach that inserts a membrane protein with an available protein coordinate file into a pregenerated lipid membrane. The PDB file is used which was created with the I-TASSER program (the model as depicted in Fig. 1b) and this is used as input for the ProBLM software. In the result as depicted in Fig. 1c, a lipid bilayer membrane is used that contains phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) lipids. Obviously, the result requires further handling, for example, a minimization step using molecular dynamics tools (see, for more details and an initial result; supplementary materials). According to the makers of this program, single-spanning alpha-helical transmembrane proteins can tend to give an axis that may be tilted with respect to the membrane normal (Kimmett et al. 2014). Although manual adjustment is possible, it is not done here since to which extent it is valid to look closer at the helical lipid-binding regions in this model is somewhat questionable since two of the identified lipid-binding regions AA 120–137 and AA 151–168 are anionic phospholipid dependent (since the Heliquest approach indicates a preference of the identified regions for anionic phospholipid membranes and the protein has been demonstrated to be anionic phospholipid dependent for its binding (Weiss et al. 1999; Maron et al. 2009) and unfortunately anionic lipids cannot be used in the ProBLM software. However, the corresponding PDB files are available for those who want to submit the conformations to a further analysis (see supplement). The model as depicted in Fig. 1c indicates that Pam18 and the helical regions can be positioned in the membrane and is included for indicative purposes.Fig. 1 Ribbon presentation of the truncated Pam18, PDB entry 2GUZ (a). The creation of the PDB file of the full Pam18 by I-TASSER (b). This PDB file is used to view the full protein embedded in a phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) membrane with the use of the ProBLM server (c). In a and b, the N-termini are depicted in blue and towards the C-termini the color turns into red




More details can be found by focusing on the individual lipid-binding regions. The two identified lipid-binding regions AA 120–137 and AA 151–168 were analyzed further by the MCPep program. This MC approach allows a simulation of the two helical peptides upon possible binding to both neutral and negatively charged phospholipids. For neutral membranes, the MCPep program was unable to identify transmembrane or surface bound configurations (data not shown). The results for the two helical lipid-binding regions AA 120–137 and AA 151–168 with membranes containing 20 % anionic phospholipids are depicted in Fig. 2. The MCPep result of the other region, the transmembrane region AA 66–83, is somewhat complicated. It appeared that although the Heliquest program identified this region as a clear transmembrane region, MCPep was unable to come up with a transmembrane configuration (see supplement Fig. S1). However, taken a closer look at the hydrophobic scale (or better the free energy data) of the amino acids on which the MCPep method is based on (Kessel and Ben-Tal 2002) then it becomes apparent that the tyrosine corresponds, according to this scale, to a very hydrophilic amino acid. Since this particular membrane region contains two tyrosine amino acids, this could very well explain why MCPep cannot put such a region in the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Tyrosine must, however, most likely be considered as a medium hydrophobic amino acid with a polar character, so medium in terms of hydrophobic/hydrophilic (see also supplement for further details on this). Indeed when those two amino acids were replaced by a hydrophobic amino acid such as leucine, a perfect transmembrane configuration was found by MCPep (see Fig. S1 in the supplement). The helical wheel plot in Heliquest is identical (see supplement); the mean hydrophobicity is even higher (more than 1, data not shown) again leading to the conclusion that we are dealing here with a TM helix. There is, however, another indication that this particular region is not a straightforward and easy to detect transmembrane helix, since the state-of-the-art topology prediction method TOPCONS (Bernsel et al. 2009) had great difficulties in identifying this region (see the supplement for further details). In this respect, it is interesting to note that earlier findings demonstrated that a truncated Pam18/Tim14 protein that lacks this transmembrane region is still functional in vivo (Mokranjac et al. 2006), already indicating the special nature of this TM helix and membrane protein. In conclusion, it seems that Pam18 contains two novel potential helical lipid-binding regions and one possible transmembrane region.Fig. 2 MCPep results of Pam14 lipid-binding regions AA 120–137 (a) and AA 151–168 (b). Monte Carlo simulations of peptide interactions with membranes containing 20 % anionic phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol, PG) are depicted (see “Materials and methods” for details)



Some additional characterizations of lipid-binding regions of other subunits
Some issues in the presented results are interesting and important to check somewhat further. For example, the Pam16 region AA 5–22 is according to the Heliquest-generated Eisenberg plot approach (Keller 2011a) closely situated to the membrane protein area in a hydrophobic moment plot, since the mean hydrophobicity ⟨H⟩ found (0.735) is close to the threshold value 0.75 as defined by the Heliquest-generated Eisenberg plot approach (Keller 2011a). Indeed, a TOPCONS analysis indicates the likely presence of a transmembrane region at region 2–22 which is remarkably close to the region found with Heliquest (see supplement for further details). These results explain why in the current literature (see for example Bajaj et al. 2014) Pam16 is often depicted without a TM helix and contains a hydrophobic region instead (Mokranjac et al. 2006).

Another interesting example is related to the Pam17 transmembrane regions AA 52–69 and AA 87–104 which were identified as transmembrane helical regions according to the Heliquest approach; both values of ⟨H⟩ were found to be above the threshold value of 0.75 (see Table 1). For the AA 87–104, no TM configuration could be found by the use of MCPep (instead a surface configuration was given, data not shown). However, a slightly shifted region AA 89–109 was clearly a transmembrane configuration according to MCPep. This example of the MCPep analysis is depicted in Fig. 3. Indeed the corresponding peptide gave a typical example of a transmembrane helix when inserted in a lipid membrane containing 20 % anionic phospholipids.Fig. 3 Monte Carlo simulations of peptide interactions with membranes containing 20 % anionic phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol, PG) corresponding to one of the Pam17 transmembrane regions AA 87–104 (or more precise AA 89–109, see for details “Results” section) (a) and the Tim44 surface seeking region AA 301–318 (b)



Finally in the Tim44, the only example of a typical surface seeking helix was predicted by the Heliquest approach, according to rule that a region needs to be above the following line ⟨μH⟩ = 0.645 − 0.324 ⟨H⟩ (see Table 1). The MCPep result of this surface seeking region AA 301–318 upon interaction with phospholipid membrane containing 20 % anionic phospholipids is depicted in Fig. 3. Indeed the corresponding peptide corresponds to a typical picture of a surface seeking helix upon binding to a membrane containing negatively charged lipids. It is important to note that results found by the MCPep approach confirm the results as found by Heliquest. In other words, the MCPep only will give significant clusters of surface bound or transmembrane configurations when the peptide corresponding to a particular lipid-binding region, according to the calculations of the program, interacts with phospholipids.

Discussion
It is clear that based on the results as shown in this paper, potential helical lipid-binding regions were found for proteins belonging to the mitochondrial protein translocation motor. For example, it has been demonstrated that Pam18 contains three potential helical lipid-binding regions (Table 1). One of the identified regions corresponds with the well-described presence of a transmembrane helix. The unclear nature and apparent difficulty to predict and characterize this region as described in this paper might correspond to the finding that Tim14 lacking its transmembrane anchor is still functional in vivo (Mokranjac et al. 2006). Two additional novel lipid-binding regions were identified and described here (Table 1). The ProBLM result as depicted in Fig. 1 seems to indicate a possible membrane embedded conformation. Additional works needs to be done to make this result more than useful for indicative purposes; however, further characterization of the three lipid-binding regions using MCPep leads to a more detailed picture of the identified lipid-binding regions, one possible transmembrane region and two tilted surface bound conformations. The MCPep results indicate the possibility to get further in-depth knowledge of the protein–lipid interactions in more mechanistic terms (see for example Figs. 2, 3).

The earlier finding that mtHsp70 contains multiple lipid-binding regions (Keller 2011a) and the presented paper indicates that in the other subunits of the mitochondrial protein import motor possible helical lipid-binding regions can be identified as well. As discussed previously (Keller 2014), the lipid-binding regions are not expected to be conserved (in terms of primary sequence), since they are based on overall physicochemical features (like the mean hydrophobicity ⟨H⟩ and charge z) of the regions. Although not conserved in terms of primary sequence, lipid-binding regions are found in different organisms for similar proteins, like SecD (Keller 2013) and SecA (Keller 2014). In relation to this, it is perhaps important to stress that methods like Heliquest and MCPep do not allow a closer look at the lipid specificity, although Heliquest can indirectly discriminate between neutral and negatively charged phospholipids by the z value in the lipid discrimination factor or as indicated by the researchers behind the Heliquest program (see http://heliquest.ipmc.cnrs.fr/TablePeptide.htm), the lipid-binding prediction correlates well with the “ability of a segment to bind in vitro to large liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine and negatively charged lipids (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylglycerol)”. The MCPep allows the user to adapt the amount of anionic phospholipids in the membrane used for the simulations but at least the freely available online version does not allow the introduction of different kind of lipids.

The accuracy of the predictions of potential helical lipid-binding regions is based on comparison of the predictions with numerous data of experimentally demonstrated lipid-binding regions (see Gautier et al. 2008; Keller 2011a for more details). In this respect, it is interesting to note that the finding of such potential helical lipid-binding regions in one of the Hsp70 proteins (Keller 2011a) has recently been substantiated by the experimental evidence for the existence of protein–lipid interactions for human Hsp70 (Mahalka et al. 2014). Intriguingly, similar results were found for the Sec system motor protein SecA (Keller 2011a). There is already some experimental evidence for the existence of a number of those lipid-binding regions in SecA (Breukink et al. 1993, 1995). Recently, an elegant approach demonstrated how it is possible to dissect the role of a lipid-binding region in factors like membrane binding, lipid specificity and channel activities once you focus on one of those lipid-binding regions of SecA (Floyd et al. 2014) and basically confirmed the existence of the predicted N-terminal lipid-binding regions AA 1–21 and AA 14–33 in E. coli SecA (Keller 2011a). A substantial number of potential helical lipid-binding regions in a number of subunits of the mitochondrial protein import motor are predicted in this paper and some of those regions were characterized further in silico (see Table 1). Taken this altogether, this could indicate that the identified possible helical lipid-binding regions in the mitochondrial protein import motor might play a novel and active role in the protein translocation of proteins across the mitochondrial membrane. It would be interesting to see if certain lipid-binding regions are involved in a particular stage of the protein translocation process, like in the initial stages as has been suggested for Tim44 (Weiss et al. 1999), while others might be involved in later stages of the process.

The role of anionic phospholipids in the protein translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane using the Sec system is well studied (see for a review van Klompenburg and de Kruijff 1998). In the mitochondrial protein translocation, the number of papers with the phospholipids as focus is limited. Some indirect indications of the involvement of phospholipids are described in the literature. For example, the finding that control of the cardiolipin metabolism and the effect on the assembly of Tim23 and the regulation of the association with PAM are related matters seems to imply an involvement of cardiolipin in the mitochondrial protein sorting (Tamura et al. 2009). The way phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and cardiolipin (CL) affect the stability of mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes has been studied in quite some detail and the subsequent effect on the inner membrane potential ∆ψ, important for protein translocation, was demonstrated (Böttinger et al. 2012). This seems to indicate that one of the roles of (certain) phospholipids is to keep the protein translocation machinery in a protein translocation competent state. There are some indications that specific protein-anionic phospholipid interactions in mitochondrial protein sorting do play a role, as discussed before (Weiss et al. 1999, Marom et al. 2009). For example, it was shown that anionic phospholipids induce a marked conformational change in the mitochondrial presequence (Epand et al. 1986). The interactions of apocytochrome c with anionic phospholipids are studied in great detail (see for example Snel et al. 1994). Interesting to note that all the regions identified to be of importance for apocytochrome c interaction with phospholipids that were determined experimentally could be identified by the Heliquest lipid discrimination factor D as well (Keller 2011a). A great step in the elucidation of the role of each component in the mitochondrial protein translocation process is the development of a reconstitution system and preliminary results clearly indicate the necessity for cardiolipin (van der Laan et al. 2007). There is an excellent review published that not only summarized the current status of our knowledge about the lipid involvement in mitochondrial protein translocation but also highlighted some important remaining issues that need to be resolved (Gebert et al. 2011). In this respect, the newly identified possible helical lipid-binding regions in subunits of the mitochondrial protein import motor as presented in this paper might give new tools for further investigations. The observation that in different motor proteins belonging to two different protein translocation systems multiple helical lipid-binding regions can be identified is intriguing enough for a closer look.

Introduction
Black rot, caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Pammel) Dowson is a major seed-borne biotic constraint for cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.) production by all over the world which causes substantial crop loss especially during warm, humid seasons (Williams 1980). The pathogen enters the plant through the hydathodes and spreads in the vasculature of the leaf and stem. The typical symptom of black rot is the occurrence of V-shaped chlorotic lesions with vertices towards the mid rib of the leaves.

The development and use of black rot-resistant cultivars have long been recognized as important methods of controlling the disease. The inheritance of major gene resistance has been studied in the diploid B. rapa (A genome) and in the tetraploids B. carinata (BC genome) and B. napus (AC genome) (Guo et al. 1991; Ignatov et al. 2000). A single dominant race-specific gene has been mapped to the A genome in B. napus (Vicente et al. 2002), and QTLs that control resistance to at least two of the most prevalent races of X. campestris pv. campestris have been mapped in a Chinese cabbage accession of B. rapa (Soengas et al. 2007).

Durable resistance to black rot can be imparted by the genes present in the A and B genomes of Brassica. To achieve this aim, genes from the wild relative Arabidopsis thaliana could potentially be easier and quicker to characterize molecularly, and either be used directly in transgenic brassica crops, or facilitate the identification and interspecific transfer of homologous black rot resistance genes from A or B genome sources into vegetable crops. Interestingly, most A. thaliana accessions are resistant to one or more races of X. campestris pv. campestris, and more than half exhibit broad-spectrum resistance to all major races of the pathogen suggesting that this wild relative of brassica crops could indeed provide useful sources of durable black rot resistance (Holub 2007). A. thaliana and X. campestris pv. campestris provided one of the earliest experimental models for the investigation of the interactions of A. thaliana with a major crop pathogen, the molecular basis of natural variation in black rot resistance is largely unexplored in this pathosystem (Simpson and Johnson 1990).

Defense-related enzymes have a broad action spectrum activity and play key roles in plant–pathogen interactions. Peroxidase is one of the most important factors of the plant’s biochemical defense against pathogenic microorganisms, and is actively involved in the self-regulation of plant metabolism after infection. Peroxidase activity has been associated with pathogenesis, which in turn leads to reinforcement of cell walls with phenolic compounds. Progress in identifying defense mechanisms in cabbage has been very slow, and few defense-related genes in cabbage have been characterized. Functional genomics and proteomics studies in both resistant and susceptible host plants inoculated with X. campestris pv. campestris will provide key information on the interaction between the bacteria and the host. The control of black rot is still a worldwide threat and development of black rot-resistant cultivars is very essential as only few black rot-resistant cultivars are known worldwide (Vicente and Holoub 2013).

Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) is a PCR-based method used to generate unbiased cDNAs library and amplifies only differentially expressed cDNAs. The target cDNA library called as the tester population is denatured, and hybridized to the driver cDNAs population present in the excess. Common fragments to both anneal to each other, whereas tester-specific products remain single stranded represent the differentially expressed genes. SSH is used to generate expressed sequence tags (EST).

The present study involves isolation of genes involved in the resistance to the black rot pathogen in cabbage. The suppression subtractive hybridization method (Diatchenko et al. 1996) was used to generate cDNA libraries enriched in sequences expressed in cabbage leaves during the early stages of hypersensitive response (HR). Several studies indicated that a large number of plant genes are transcriptionally regulated upon challenge by a pathogen, but that most of them may be common to both compatible and incompatible interactions (Maleck et al. 2000). For focusing on genes strictly involved in the hypersensitive response, cDNA from resistant cabbage cv. Pusa mukta plants infected with X. campestris pv. campestris (incompatible interaction) were subtracted with Pusa mukta (uninfected). Here we present a catalogue of cabbage non-redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and we describe the identification of genes for which expression is regulated during the early events of X. campestris pv. campestris infection process. These defense genes provide an important genomic resource for understanding the interactions between cabbage and black rot pathogen. The resistance mechanism of a cabbage cultivar has been assessed for the first time in India at the molecular level.

Materials and methods
Screening of cabbage seed samples for the black rot incidence under green house conditions
Seeds of different cabbage cultivars were procured from local traders in Mysore and the cvs. Pusa mukta and Golden acre from Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, India. All seeds were surface sterilized with 1 % (v/v) sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 min and washed with distilled water thrice. Cabbage cultivars were screened against black rot under green house conditions and the severity of black rot was recorded following 0–5 scale as proposed by Singh et al. (1987). Cabbage seedlings were raised in plastic pots (9 cm diameter) filled with mixture of sterilized soil, sand and farmyard manure (2:1:1). For each cultivar 15 plants in four replicates each were maintained. Xanthomonascampestris pv. campestris culture was maintained on nutrient starch cycloheximide agar medium (NSCA). The inoculum was prepared and the 15-day-old-seedlings were covered with polythene sheet, 2 h before inoculation to increase humidity. The cabbage seedlings were spray inoculated with Xanthomonascampestris pv. campestris (1 × 108 cfu/ml).

Disease scoring
Disease development was monitored by visual examination of the percentage of total symptomatic area. It was assessed for each leaf for the appearance of V-shaped lesions. Measurements were taken upon the first appearance of black rot symptoms (vascular darkening, black rot lesions, and chlorosis), and every 24 h afterward, for a period of 12 days. The following rating scales for the visual disease estimation were employed as per Singh et al. (1987): 0, no visible symptoms (immune I); 1, 1–5 % infection (resistant, R); 2, 6–15 % infection (moderately resistant MR); 3, 16–30 % infection (moderately susceptible, MS); 4, 31–50 % infection (susceptible, S) and 5, >50 % infection (highly susceptible, HS).

Suppression subtractive hybridization
Cabbage leaves were harvested at 12, 24 and 48 h post-inoculation (hpi) with Xanthomonascampestris pv. campestris (UOMBT-6 isolate), either eliciting an incompatible interaction or a compatible interaction and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant kit (Qiagen, France). RNA yield was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm in a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U-2000, Tokyo, Japan) and RNA integrity was checked by electrophoresing 3 µg of total RNA through 1.2 % agarose gel. Poly (A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA using mRNA purification kit (BangaloreGenei, Bangalore, India).

Suppression subtractive hybridization was performed as described by Diatchenko et al. (1996) using PCR select cDNA subtraction kit (BD biosciences Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Approximately 400 ng of tester and driver cDNA was digested with Rsa I in a 40 µl reaction mixture containing 30 units of enzyme for 4 h at 37 °C. The restricted cDNA fragments were purified using a MinElute reaction clean up kit (Qiagen, France) and eluted from MinElute columns in 10 µl sterile water. Digested tester cDNA (1 µl) was diluted in 5 µl of water. A 2 µl aliquot of the diluted tester cDNA was then either ligated to 2 µl of adaptor 1 (10 µM) or 2 µl of adaptor 1 (10 µM) in separate ligation reactions in a total volume of 10 µl at 14 °C overnight using two units of T4 DNA ligase (BD Biosciences clonetech) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. After ligation reactions were heated at 72 °C for 5 min to inactivate the ligase.

Thereafter 1.5 µl of ds cDNA together with 1 µl hybridization buffer (BD Biosciences clonetech) was added to each of two tubes containing 1.5 µl of adapter 1 and adapter 2R ligated tester cDNA (1:10) diluted, respectively. The solution was overlaid with mineral oil, the DNA was denatured (1.5 min, 98 °C) and then allowed to anneal for 12 h at 68 °C. After this first hybridization, the two samples were combined and a fresh portion of heat-denatured driver (100 ng) in 1 µl hybridization buffer was added. The sample was left to hybridize for an additional 16 h at 68 °C for 7 min and stored at −20 °C until use. The final ratio of the tester to driver in both the forward and reverse subtraction experiments was 300:1. Six separate suppressive PCR amplification reactions were performed for the forward and reverse subtracted cDNA samples.

cDNA library construction and amplification of cDNA inserts
Suppression subtractive hybridization was performed as described by Diatchenko et al. (1996) using PCR select cDNA subtraction kit (BD biosciences Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA obtained from Xanthomonascampestris pv. campestris inoculated Pusa mukta cultivar at 12, 24 and 48 hpi (hours post-inoculation) was used as “tester” population and cDNA from the uninoculated Pusa mukta was used as “driver” population. The efficiency of subtraction was analyzed by comparing cDNA abundance before and after subtraction by PCR using specific primers for the constitutively expressed cabbage-specific 18S rRNA gene (Table 1). PCR amplification was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (BangaloreGenei, Bangalore, India) and 5 µl aliquots were removed following determined numbers of PCR cycles. The amplified products were examined in 2 % agarose gel. The differences in the number of cycles, which were needed to generate an approximately equal amount of the corresponding PCR product in subtracted and unsubtracted samples, served to indicate the subtraction efficiency.Table 1 List of primers used for the gene expression studies

Cloning of the subtracted cDNA
The secondary PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, France). The subtracted cDNA fragments were cloned into the pGEMT-easy using a pGEMT-easy cloning kit (Promega, USA) and transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 cells. Individual colonies containing recombinant plasmids were inoculated into 100 µl Luria–Bertani broth in 96 well microtitre plates. Cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C with gentle shaking (100 rpm). 100 µl of 15 % glycerol was added to each of the wells and the microtitre plates were stored at −80 °C until use.

Identification of insert size of cDNA by PCR amplification
Sequencing of cDNA clones was performed using T7 or SP6 primer. In order to correct the sequencing amibiguities, the sequences were edited by removing the plasmid and SSH adaptor sequences. The edited sequences were used to query the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA) databases using the blastX, blastN and dbEST algorithms (Altschul et al. 1990). The cDNA were classified according to the E-values generated in the searches. Sequences were checked for stop codons to ensure that cDNA fragments represented a position of open reading frame.

Enzyme studies
Preparation of crude enzyme extracts
Seeds of all the cabbage cultivars were plated onto moist blotter discs placed in a 9-cm-diameter petri dish, at a density of 25 seeds per plate following standard procedures of the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA 2003). The plates were incubated at 28 ± 2 °C for 8 days until the cotyledons completely opened. The 12-day-old seedlings were spray inoculated with X.campestris pv. campestris (UOMBT-6). The seedlings were harvested 48 h post-inoculation (hpi) and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further use.

Cabbage seedlings (1 g) were macerated to a fine paste in a pre-chilled mortar with 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.8) (w/v; 1:1). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was used directly for enzyme assay. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and the supernatant served as enzyme source for peroxidase (POX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD).

Peroxidase assay
Peroxidase (POX) activities were measured at room temperature according to the standardized procedure of He et al. (2001). The POX assay reaction mixture contained 7.5 μL of 10 mM guaiacol in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 100 μl of crude extract, 792.5 μl of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and 100 μl of 600 mM H2O2. The change in optical density at 470 nm was measured for 1 min. POX activity was calculated as change in absorbance units min−1 mg−1.

Superoxide dismutase assay
Total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was assayed based on the method of Beauchamp and Fridovich (1971) as described by Madamanchi and Alscher (1991) by measuring the ability of the enzyme to inhibit the photochemical reduction of nitro-blue tetrazolium. The 3 ml reaction mixture contained 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), containing 0.1 mM EDTA, 13 mM methionine, 75 mM nitro-blue tetrazolium, 2 mM riboflavin, and the tissue extract. Riboflavin was added last, the tubes were stirred and the reaction was initiated by placing the tubes under two 15 W fluorescent lamps. The reaction was terminated after 10 min by switching off the light. Non-illuminated tubes served as a blank. Blue color was measured at 560 nm. Activity was expressed in enzyme units per mg protein. The volume of enzyme extract corresponding to the 50 % inhibition of the reaction was considered as one enzyme unit.

Catalase activity assay
Catalase (CAT) activity was determined by measuring the rate of decrease in absorbance at 240 nm of a solution of 30 Mm H2O2 in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 25 °C (Bunaurio 1987). Activity was expressed in enzyme units per mg protein. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the decomposition of 1 mmol H2O2 min−1 calculated from the extinction coefficient for H2O2 at 240 nm of 0.036 cm2 mmol.

Temporal pattern of enzymes
Seeds of all the cabbage cultivars were plated onto moist blotter discs placed in a 9-cm-diameter petri dish, at a density of 25 seeds per plate following standard procedures of the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA 2003). The plates were incubated at 28 ± 2 °C for 8 days until the cotyledons completely opened. The temporal pattern of POX, SOD and CAT was studied in two different cultivars, that were resistant (Pusa mukta) and highly susceptible (cv. NBH boss) based on disease incidence under greenhouse conditions. The cabbage seedlings raised as above were harvested at different time intervals: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 up to 60 h after pathogen inoculation (hpi) and subjected to enzyme estimations as explained previously. Samples inoculated with distilled water served as control.

Protein estimation
Protein content of the extracts for all the estimated enzymes was determined using the standard procedure of Bradford (1976) with BSA (Sigma, USA) as standard.

Native-PAGE analyses of POX, SOD and CAT
The isoforms profiles of POX, SOD and CAT were examined by discontinuous native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native-PAGE) following the procedure of Laemmli (1970) and Yang et al. (1999) with slight modifications, respectively. Enzyme extracts (60 mg protein) of R and HS cabbage cultivars at 12, 18 and 15 h of both inoculated and control were loaded onto 8 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gels with a vertical mini-gel electrophoresis unit (Biometra, Gottingen, Germany). The electrode buffer was Tris base (6.0 g Tris base, 14.4 g glycine and 1 l distilled water). Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 50 V initially for 1 h and 100 V to complete electrophoresis.

Activity staining for POX
After electrophoresis, POX isoforms were visualized by soaking the gels in staining solution containing 100 mg benzidine dissolved in 1 ml of absolute alcohol and made up to 40 ml using distilled water. Clear solution was obtained by adding 500 ml of glacial acetic acid to the above mixture and undissolved particles of benzidine were removed by filtering the solution through cotton. H2O2 (250 ml) was added to the filtered solution at the end and gels were incubated in the solution until bands appeared (Schrauwen 1966).

Activity staining for SOD
After electrophoresis, SOD isoforms were visualized by completely submerging the gel in freshly prepared staining buffer containing 50 mM phosphate buffer, 0.1 ml EDTA, 28 mM TEMED, 0.003 mM riboflavin and 0.25 mM nitroblue tetrazolium for 30 min in dark condition. Thereafter, the gel was placed on an illuminated glass plate until the bands become visible.

Activity staining for CAT
CAT activity was performed following the procedure of Yang et al. (1999). The gel was first rinsed three times with distilled water and then incubated in 0.003 % H2O2 for 10 min. The gel was then stained with 2 % ferric chloride and 2 % potassium ferricyanide; when chromatic bands appeared, the stain was drained off the gel and the gel was rinsed thoroughly to stop the reaction and the washed with distilled water. Achromatic bands demonstrated the presence of CAT activity.

Statistical analysis
All the experiments were performed twice with similar results. The data obtained from green house experiments were analyzed separately for each experiment and were subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the statistical software SAS (version 9.0). The means were compared for significance using Fisher’s LSD. Significant effects of pathogen inoculation on enzyme activities were determined by the magnitude of F value (p = 0.05).

Semiquantitative RT-PCR for POX, SOD and CAT
Total RNA of resistant (cv. Pusa mukta) and susceptible (cv. NBH boss) cultivars was isolated from leaf samples of 12, 24 and 48 hpi with X.campestris pv. campestris using plant RNeasy kit (Qiagen, France). The mRNA was purified using mRNA purification kit (Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India). One-step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (BangaloreGenei, Bangalore, India) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA was diluted (1:5) with RNase-free water and used as a template for PCR. The RT-PCR primers were designed from the selected unigenes using primer Quest Integrated DNA Technologies (Table 1).

Cabbage 18S rRNA was used as endogenous control. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out and the PCR cycling parameters consisted of 94 °C for 2 min, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min and extension at 72 °C for 2 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min followed by 16 cycles of POX, 20 cycles for SOD, 22 cycles for CAT and 25 cycles for 18S rRNA.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Primer pairs specific to POX, SOD and CAT were designed for qRT-PCR from the sequence obtained from the SSH library. The primers were checked for specificity by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Each reaction consisted of 10 µl consisting of 5 µl of SYBR green PCR master, 2 µl nuclease-free water and 1 µl of reverse transcribed cDNA product, qRT-PCR was performed using single one real-time PCR system (Roche, Switzerland). The thermocycler program had an initial 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles consisting of 30 s denaturation at 95 °C, 60 s annealing and extension at 60 °C. At the end of each reaction, a melting curve analysis (64–95 °C with a heating rate of 0.5 °C/s) was performed to determine the specificity of the reaction.

Results
Screening of cabbage seed samples for the black rot incidence under greenhouse conditions
The ten cabbage cultivars used in the study were classified based on the appearance of black rot incidence which ranged between 4 and 66 %. The Pusa mukta cultivar showed 3 % disease incidence and hence considered as the resistant cultivar, five cultivars (Indam krishna, Gaurav, Indam saina, Unnati and NS 43) were moderately resistant (6–14 %), two cultivars (Golden acre, Quisto) were susceptible (30–33 %) and two cultivars (F1 bhima and NBH boss) were highly susceptible (63–66 %) to black rot disease under green house conditions (Table 2).Table 2 Screening of cabbage cultivars for the presence of black rot disease under green house conditions

Construction of subtracted library
Cabbage leaf samples of resistant cultivar Pusa mukta were harvested at 12, 24 and 48 hpi and used to identify differentially expressed genes upon inoculation with X.campestris pv. campestris. A cDNA subtractive library was constructed wherein X. campestris pv. campestris inoculated leaf samples acted as the tester and uninoculated leaf samples as driver. The subtraction efficiency was evaluated by expression of the 18S rRNA between subtracted and unsubtracted cDNAs. The amount of 18S rRNA decreased significantly after subtraction and could be detected in agarose gel at 28 PCR cycles whereas in the unsubtracted samples 18SrRNA was detected at 18 PCR cycles. This indicated that the subtraction had worked well. Finally 1000 clones were obtained and 500 clones were randomly selected from the library and the insert size was detected by PCR with SSH primer provided in the subtraction kit. The 300 positive clones carrying single exogenous fragment were detected and the length of the inserted fragments ranged from 200 to 700 bp.

Analysis of EST sequences
The 150 unigenes obtained from the 300 positive clones were classified into five major categories: metabolism, disease and defense-related, structural proteins, signaling pathway related and unclassified group. The metabolism-related unigenes accounted for 20 %, defense related (35 %), structural proteins (15 %), signaling pathway related (20 %) and 10 % were with unknown function or did not show any significant similarity with known genes or hypothetical proteins (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 EST classification of putative biological function based on homologies to sequences of known function detected by BLASTN searches



All the unigenes were subjected to similarity search using BLASTX, BLASTN dbEST databases. Sequences showing the E-value <10−3 were considered as significant. The most abundant group consisted of the defense-related genes catalase, peroxidase, HSP70, superoxide dismutase were prominent which are predicted to play an important role in the resistance process upon pathogen attack followed by the metabolism and structural proteins category. About 10 % of the unigenes could not be functionally categorized (Table 3). The black rot-inducible genes in cabbage obtained from the SSH cDNA library submitted dbEST with library name: LIBEST_028420 Brassica oleracea var. capitata SSH Library with the accession nos JZ585251 to JZ585260 and JZ585519 to JZ585523, respectively.Table 3 List of black rot-inducible genes in cabbage obtained from the SSH cDNA library matched upon BLAST analyses with plant genes of known functions

Enzyme studies
Temporal pattern
Temporal study was undertaken to estimate the POX, SOD and CAT enzyme activities at regular intervals from 0 to 60 h and the peak activities were noted at 12, 18 and 15 h for POX, SOD and CAT, respectively. The POX activity was high at 12 h after pathogen inoculation (hpi) in resistant cultivar Pusa mukta. The activity found to be 1.8 units at 12 h, whereas in highly susceptible cultivar the POX activity was 0.1 units at 15 hpi. This was proved by native-page analysis wherein two isoforms of POX were expressed in resistant cultivar as compared to HS (Fig. 2a, b).Fig. 2

Semiquantitative RT-PCR
Three defense-related unigenes, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase showed high homology percentage and were selected to study their expression in resistant and susceptible cultivars during infection with Xanthomonascampestris pv. campestris. The transcript level was investigated at 24 and 48 hpi. The genes were compared with the internal control being 18S rRNA. The 18S rRNA was expressed in both cultivars. The expression of the defense genes was higher in resistant cultivar. The expression of peroxidase was higher in the resistant cultivar at 48 hpi compared to the susceptible cultivar. The expression of catalase was detected in both the susceptible and resistant cultivar, but the expression was relatively higher in the resistant cultivar (Fig. 5a–c).Fig. 5

Discussion
SSH which is a powerful technique used to enrich libraries with differentially expressed cDNAs and includes a normalization step that enables detection of low abundance differentially expressed transcripts such as those involved in signaling and signal transduction and might thus identify essential components in biological processes (Birch and Kamoun 2000). The transcriptional diversity in B. oleracea var. capitata–X. campestris pv. campestris interaction in resistant cultivar Pusa mukta was studied. 150 unigenes were obtained from the 500 randomly picked positive clones. Upon functional annotation of the 150 unigenes, the ESTs with known biological function accounted for 80 % of total genes. The main aim of the study was to focus on the genes involved in resistance mechanism against X. campestris pv. campestris in resistant cultivar Pusa mukta. Pusa mukta is a resistant cultivar obtained from a cross between EC 24855 × EC 10109 by pedigree selection. It is one of the popular resistant cultivar in northern part of India, but its performance depends on the geographic location and its performance in the southern part of India was assessed.

Some reports of up-regulation of defense genes during several plant–pathogen interactions exist in the literature (Fernandez et al. 2004), suggesting the role of proteins in plant defense mechanisms. It is also established fact that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the main source of damage to cell under stress conditions. ROS scavengers like superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase are produced in significant quantity to combat the ROS produced during stress. Peroxidase accumulation and lignifications occur predominantly in the hydathodes, and to a greater extent in resistant cabbage varieties than in susceptible ones. Total peroxidase activities in hydathodal fluids were noted between resistant and susceptible cabbage varieties during pathogenesis.

The accumulation of peroxidases in the hydathodal fluids of cabbage varieties correlates positively with the level of varietal resistance to black rot. Accumulations of peroxidase in hydathodal fluids are also positively correlated with the occurrence of lignification in the hydathodal region. These results suggest that peroxidases have a dual role in black rot resistance: direct antagonism of X. campestris pv. campestris at the site of infection, as well as indirect suppression of pathogen spread via peroxidase-mediated increases in lignifications (Gay 2000). The roles of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-protective genes (katA, katG, and ahpC) and a peroxide sensor/transcription regulator (oxyR) in the viability of X. campestris pv. campestris at an elevated temperature were evaluated when exposed to multiple stresses in the environment and during interaction with a host plant with Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Sarinya et al. 2011). The study highlights the role of catalase in Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris.

The NDR1 (non-race-specific disease resistance) protein is a key component of the signaling pathway of many NBS-LRR resistance proteins. In the Pseudomonas syringae–A. thaliana interaction, NDR 1 expression is induced in response to pathogen challenge. WRKY—a transcription factor was putatively encoded. The promoter element (W-box) that binds WRKY proteins has been found in several A. thaliana genes, which exhibited common regulation patterns under different systemic acquired resistance (SAR)-inducing or -repressing conditions (Maleck et al. 2000; Fernandez et al. 2004).

HSP70 is one of the major classes of chaperone molecules and also functions in the response to pathogen attack. Therefore, HSP70 is an essential component of the hypersensitive response defense mechanism in plants. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are important intracellular mediators of the information in early defense signaling through protein phosphorylation of downstream signaling components and targets several transcription factors. Moreover, our results indicated that there was a negative relationship between catalase and peroxidase activity with SOD activity. We have identified 150 unigenes from cabbage by cDNA-SSH, representing 10 % of which are novel genes. The presence of cDNAs with non-significant matches are due to the high cut-off value which was set to increase the level of significance of matches with sequences in the databases or that these proteins/genes have not been functionally characterized yet in any plant species. Excessive ROS causes oxidative damage to the plant cell structures, nucleic acids, lipids and proteins under various biotic stress conditions. Hence the up-regulation of ROS-scavenging enzymes related transcripts such as SOD, POD and CAT transcripts in our library suggests that it protects the cell membrane. These results are in conjuncture with our biochemical findings in which a notable increase in these scavengers were observed in pathogen infected plants. Our aim was to find out differentially expressed genes in the resistant cultivar cDNA-SSH study. The EST data reported herein complement in detail to our previous studies of various Brassica sp studied. In conclusion, we have identified resistant candidate cDNAs from cabbage and 10 % of which were unclassified s being novel. We found a positive correlation in physio-biochemical and gene expression mechanisms in plant. The study has provided insights into the nature of pathogen-responsive genes in cabbage. The ESTs reported in the study can be used as candidate genes for developing molecular markers to assist breeding of black rot-resistant cabbage varieties. Defense-related genes have proven useful in cereals aimed at improving plants for increased disease resistance.

Research into X. campestris pv. campestris and closely related pathovars has now reached the genomic age, although it still lags behind the progress made from the investigation of Pseudomonas pathogens such as P. syringae pv. tomato. A number of disease resistance genes in Brassicas and A. thaliana have been postulated some have been mapped but none have been cloned. The effort to identify more disease resistance genes should be continued and some of the most important crops could be improved within the incorporation of disease resistance genes.

Efficient application of functional genomics tools for disease resistance can help us understand the plant defense signaling and could also reveal novel insights on the interactions between these signaling pathways (Chen et al. 2002). Furthermore, there is still an inadequacy of a reference set to be used as model for resistance genes that usually cluster in the genomic region. Our study has provided an insight into the host–pathogen interactions involved in resistant cabbage cultivar Pusa mukta–X. campestris pv. campestris first of its kind in the area of vegetable research. The study has also highlighted the prominent role of superoxide dismutase and catalase unigenes apart from peroxidase. The superoxide dismutase and catalase can be further utilized for marker-assisted breeding of cabbage cultivars resistant to the black rot pathogen.

Plackett–Burman design was applied to identify the significance of seven medium variables, in which sweet potato and yeast extract were found to be the significant variables for EPS production. Central composite design was applied to evaluate the optimum condition of the selected variables. Maximum EPS production of 9.3 g/L was obtained with the predicted optimal level of sweet potato 10 %, yeast extract 0.75 %, 5.5 pH, and time 100 h. The determined (R2) value was 0.97, indicating a good fitted model for EPS production. Results of this study showed that sweet potato can be utilized as a low-cost effective substrate for pullulan production in submerged fermentation.

Introduction
Biopolymers produced by a wide variety of microorganisms which are generally water soluble gums having novel and unique physical properties. Polysaccharides have found a wide range of applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and other industries. Typical industrial uses of EPS are as food coatings and packaging material due to its good film-forming properties similar to those of polyvinyl alcohol. Pullulan is used as an adhesive in the form of paste with water, as a construction material with fibers similar in strength and elasticity to those in nylon and as a bulking agent and stabilizer for tablets in the pharmaceutical industry (Deshpande et al. 1992). Many researchers have optimized the production conditions for exopolysaccharide (EPS) in submerged culture by Fomes fomentarius (Chen et al. 2008), Tremella fuciformis (Cho et al. 2006), Pholiota squarrosa (Wang et al. 2004), Agrocybe cylindracea (Kim et al. 2005), Collybia maculate (Lim et al. 2004), Cordyceps jiangxiensis (Xiao et al. 2004), Cordyceps militaris (Kim et al. 2003), Aureobasidium pullulans (Moubasher and Wahsh 2014), and Tremella mesenterica (De Baets et al. 2002).


For a wide application, the cost of medium components is one of the main factors determining the economics of a process. In the literature, several agro-based products were utilized as low-cost substrate in the medium for economic production of pullulan through fermentation process (Srikanth et al. 2014; Sharmila et al. 2013a; Goksungur et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2009). In this study, sweet potato was used as an alternative low-cost carbon source for pullulan production.

Statistical experimental designs such as Plackett–Burman (BP) design and response surface methodology (RSM) are successfully employed to screen and optimize the process parameters in bioprocess field (Sharmila et al. 2013b). RSM, an experimental strategy for seeking the optimum conditions for a multivariable system, is a much more efficient technique for optimization (Alok et al. 2013; Aarthi and Karna 2012; Baskar and Renganathan 2012; Zhou et al. 2013; Mayur et al. 2013). Central composite design (CCD) is widely employed for bioprocess optimization studies and it can give information about the interaction between variables, provide information necessary for design and process optimization. The aim of the present work is to screen and optimize the process variables for EPS production from A. pullulans MTCC 2195 using statistical techniques.

Materials and methods
Microorganism and chemicals
Aureobasidium pullulans MTCC 2195 was obtained from Microbial Type Culture Collection and Gene Bank, Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), India. Sucrose and yeast extract purchased from HiMedia Laboratories Pvt Ltd, (Mumbai, India). KH2PO4, MgSO4·7H2O, and NaCl were purchased from Qualigens fine chemicals. ZnSO4·7H2O and CuSO4·5H2O were procured from Loba Chemie. All the media components were of analytical grade, and solvents were purchased from Merck.

Inoculum and substrate preparation
Inoculum was prepared by transferring a loopful of stock culture to the growth medium. Growth medium contains (w/v) sucrose 5 %, yeast extract 0.2 %, KH2PO4 0.5 %, MgSO4.7H2O 0.02 %, and NaCl 0.1 %. The cultivation was performed at 35 °C for 3 days. Sweet potato was obtained from the local market in Chennai. It was ground into powder with a blender and passed through a sieve (80/100 mesh size) to remove large-sized particles, and the fine sweet potato powder was used for further studies.

Fermentation conditions
Aureobasidium pullulans was inoculated in a production media containing (w/v) sweet potato 10 %, yeast extract 0.5 %, (NH4)2SO4 0.4 %, NaNO3 0.4 %, NaCl 0.2 %, KH2PO4 0.2 %, MgSO4·7H2O 0.2 %, ZnSO4·7H2O 0.05 %, and CuSO4·5H2O 0.05 %, of pH 5.5. Fermentation at 35 °C for 120 h under shaking at 120 rpm with 2 % inoculum was performed. Five milliliters of the culture was taken at 120 h, and the culture was centrifuged at 14,000×g, 4 °C for 20 min. The culture supernatant was used for EPS precipitation.

Estimation of exopolysaccharide
Supernatant fluid was mixed with three volumes of 95 % ethanol, stirred vigorously, and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h to precipitate the polysaccharide, which was separated by centrifugation at 14,000×g for 20 min and dried at 90 °C for 12 h (Wu et al. 2009). The EPS concentration was expressed as milligram per milliliter.

Plackett–Burman design
Plackett–Burman design is used to screen the significant media components from large number of variables with minimum number of experiments (Plackett and Burman, 1946). This is a very economical factorial design with the run number a multiple of four and comprises two-level screening designs (Cupul et al. 2014). This design is extremely useful in screening importance of the factors affecting the production of polymer (Wang et al. 2014). This model describes no interaction among the factors that influences EPS production. Twelve experimental run was carried out to study the effect of seven medium components for EPS production. All the factors are prepared at two levels “−1” for low level and “+1” for high level. The seven factors, sweet potato, yeast extract, NH4SO4, NaNO3, NaCl, KH2PO4, and MgSO4, were studied on EPS production. ZnSO4·7H2O and CuSO4·5H2O were used as dummy variables. Table 1 shows the factors considered for investigation, and twelve experimental runs were carried out for EPS production. The fermentation was carried out for 120 h at 35 °C and 120 rpm.Table 1 Plackett–Burman experimental design for screening of media components for EPS production

Central composite design
Central composite design developed by the Minitab 14 software was used to optimize the condition of the screened variables sweet potato, yeast extract, pH, and time. Other components of the medium were (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 0.4 %, NaNO3 0.4 %, NaCl 0.2 %, KH2PO4 0.2 %, MgSO4.7H2O 0.2 %, ZnSO4·7H2O 0.05 %, and CuSO4·5H2O 0.05 % maintained as constant. Each factor in the design was studied at three levels. The minimum and maximum range of variables investigated and their values in actual and coded form are listed in Table 2. Experimental design includes 31 runs, and fermentation was carried out separately for each with replicates. The EPS concentration was taken as the dependent variable or response (Y). Regression analysis was performed on the data obtained. This resulted in an empirical model that related the response measured to the independent variables of the experiment. For any system, the model equation is represented as 1 Y=A0+ΣAiXi+ΣAiXi2+ΣAijXiXj, where Y is the predicted response, A0 the intercept, Ai the linear coefficient, and Aij is the interaction coefficient. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, and three-dimensional response surface curves were plotted by Minitab 14 software to study the interaction among these factors.Table 2 Statistical analysis of Plackett–Burman design on EPS production

Results and discussion
Screening of media components for optimization process
Seven factors of media components were examined in the Plackett–Burman design experiments with twelve different trials, and maximum EPS production was obtained for trial number 6, while the lowest production was obtained for trial number 8. The regression coefficients, t-value, and confidence level are given in Table 2. The media components showed both positive and negative effects on EPS production. Statistical analysis (t values) demonstrated that sweet potato and yeast extract had significant positive influences on the EPS production with main effects of 4.13 and 1.36, respectively. The media components namely sweet potato (A) and yeast extract (B) were found to increase on EPS production at their high level. Whereas the media components namely (NH4)2SO4 (C), NaNO3 (D), NaCl (E), K2HPO4 (F), and MgSO4 (G) were found to decrease the EPS production at their higher level.

With the calculated p values at 90 % confidence level being considered to be significant factor, sweet potato (confidence level = 100 %) and yeast extract (confidence level = 99.4 %) were identified as the significant media components for EPS production. Hence, the main effect of media components was also studied graphically using Pareto chart as shown in Fig. 1. In this result, sweet potato has the highest confidence level of 100 %, indicating that it is the key factor for EPS production.Fig. 1 Pareto plot for Plackett–Burman parameter estimates for seven medium components.

Media optimization using central composite design
The final medium optimization and interaction amongst the screened factors were studied using CCD. All the experiments were carried out in replicates, and average EPS given in Table 3 was subjected to multiple linear regression analysis. The effect of sweet potato, yeast extract, pH, and time for EPS production was described in the form of second-order polynomial model in coded units (Eq. 2).Table 3 CCD matrix of independent variables used in RSM with corresponding experimental and predicted values of EPS production

The student’s t test and F-test were performed to determine the significance of the model. The residuals analysis was performed to validate the model at 95 % confidence level. In this model, the R2 value of 0.979 indicated that the response model can explain 97.9 % of the total variations. In general, a regression model having an R2 value higher than 0.9 is considered to have a very high correlation (Haaland 1989). The value of the adjusted determination coefficient (Radj2 = 96 %) was also high enough to indicate the significance of the model. The model fitted well with EPS production, and the optimal values from the model were justified (p < 0.001). The ANOVA results given in Table 4 indicate that the linear and square terms in second-order polynomial model (Eq. 2) were highly significant (p < 0.005) and adequate to represent the relationship between EPS production.Table 4 Analysis of variance of second-order Polynomial model for effect of variable on EPS production

The 3D response surface or contour plots were employed to determine the interaction of the fermentation conditions and the optimum levels for EPS production. The shape of the contour plot is used to identify the interaction of variables. Strong interaction exists if contour lines are elliptical in shape, and no interaction is observed if contour lines are circular. The mutual effect of sweet potato and yeast extract is shown in Fig. 2a. Maximum EPS production was obtained at the middle level of the variables and there was no interaction between the variables as contour lines are circular in shape. Figure 2b shows the combined effect of sweet potato and pH on the response, and a significant interaction exists between sweet potato and pH. The amylase enzyme synthesized by A. pullulans strain can degrade the sweet potato starch 
into simple carbohydrate molecules and be utilized for pullulan production as reported in previous studies (Manitchotpisit et al. 2011; Saha and Bothast 1993). As can be observed from Fig. 2c, EPS level increases as the time and sweet potato concentration increase till an optimal point is reached and EPS production decreases with further increase of time. Figure 2d shows that high and low level of yeast extract and pH have no significant effect on the EPS production and increased production was observed at middle level of yeast extract with pH. The interaction effect of yeast extract and time on EPS production is shown in Fig. 2e, while other factors were fixed as a constant. It was observed that the EPS production was reduced at low and high level, whereas increases towards middle level of yeast extract and time. Yeast extract in the production medium is essential nutrient to switch the morphological character (mycelial growth) of A. pullulans for pullulan synthesis. Figure 2f shows that strong interaction was observed between pH and time on EPS production as the contour is elliptical and maximum level was observed at middle level of pH and time. In other reports, optimal conditions for polymer production were obtained at an initial pH of 5.0 (Vijayendra et al. 2001), 6.5 (Roukas and Biliaderis 1995), and 7.5 (Auer and Seviour 1990). The different optimal initial pH values reported in the literature may be due to the different strains, compositions of fermentation media, and culture conditions used in those studies. Maximum EPS of 9.3 g/L obtained in this study has good agreement with the results reported by Moubasher and Wahsh (2014). In contrast to our results, maximum pullulan yield was obtained with sweet potato starch and hydrolysed potato starch waste as reported earlier (Goksungur et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2009). The variation in pullulan production may be due to type of A. pullulans strain, medium components, and process conditions.Fig. 2 Contour plots showing the combined effect of the medium variables (sweet potato, yeast extract, pH, and time) on EPS production by Aureobasidium pullulans




Conclusion
Statistical optimization was confirmed to be a powerful method for the optimization of the EPS production by A. pullulans MTCC 2195. The medium components, sweet potato and yeast extract, were screened to be the most significant components that influence the EPS production by PB experiment. CCD was proposed to study the interaction effects of fermentation condition. Maximum EPS production 9.3 g/L was obtained using the optimized condition of sweet potato 10 (%), yeast extract 0.75 (%), 5.5 pH, and time 100 h. Results of this showed that sweet potato may be used as an alternate carbon source for economical production of pullulan biopolymer.

Introduction
Xylan is the major hemicellulosic constituent of hard and soft wood and is the next
most abundant renewable polysaccharide after cellulose. This complex heteropolysaccharide consists
of a main chain of 1,4-β-d-xylose monomers and short chain
branches consisting of O-acetyl, α-l-arabinofuranosyl and α-d-glucuronyl residues.
Xylanases and associated debranching enzymes produced by a variety of microorganisms including
bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi, bring about the hydrolysis of hemicelluloses (Maheshwari et
al. 2000). Xylanolytic enzymes are receiving increasing
attention because of their potential application in pulp bleaching (Goluguri et al. 2012; Singh et al. 2013)
and bioconversion of lignocelluloses into feedstocks and fuels (Kim et al. 2000). The xylan degrading system includes endo-1,4-xylanases
(1,4-β-xylan xylanohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.8), which release long and short xylo-oligosaccharides, and
other xylanases that attack only longer chains, and β-d-xylosidase (1,4-β-xylan xylohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.37), which remove d-xylose residues from short xylo-oligosaccharides (Gomez et al.
2008; Saha 2003).

Cellulase-free xylanases are important in the paper and pulp industry as
alternatives to the use of toxic chlorinated compounds (Li et al. 2010; Woldesenbet et al. 2012; Walia et
al. 2014). For the last two decades the bleaching of
pulp has become an issue of great concern, primarily because of the environmental hazards caused by
the release of the adsorbable organic halogens and due to increasing public awareness thereof
(Goluguri et al. 2012).

The commercial application of xylanase in various industrial processes has had
limited success due to various factors. These include inaccessibility of substrate to xylanase
enzymes because of physical limitations, the limited hydrolysis of xylans due to their branched
nature, thermal instability, narrow pH range, end product inhibition and cost of enzyme production.
The last two problems can be overcome to some extent by the use of cheap substrates and by employing
the process of solid-state fermentation (SSF).

Cellulosimicrobium cellulans CKMX1 grows well on apple pomace in
solid-state culture conditions and produces a high level of xylanase (Walia et al. 2013). The optimal culture medium for this strain for SSF has not
yet been developed and designing such a medium would improve significantly the yield and quality of
xylanase. There are two ways by which the problem of fermentation parameters may be addressed:
classical and statistical. The classical method is based on the “one-factor-at-a-time” method in
which one independent variable is studied while maintaining all the other factors at a fixed level
(Li et al. 2007a; Khucharoenphaisan et al. 2008). This method may lead to unreliable results, inaccurate
conclusions and requires a considerable amount of work and time. Moreover, it does not guarantee the
determination of optimal conditions and is unable to detect the frequent interactions occurring
between two or more factors. An alternate strategy is a statistical approach, e.g. factorial
experimental design and response surface methodology (RSM) (Coman and Bahrim 2011), involving a minimum number of experiments for a large number
of factors to determine and simultaneously solve multivariate equations, by which improvement in
enzyme production has been demonstrated successfully (Katapodis et al. 2007; Ellouze et al. 2008; Khucharoenphaisan et al. 2008).

Cultural conditions and process parameters i.e. type of medium, particle size of
carbon source, incubation period, temperature, initial pH, inoculum size and nutritional parameters
were optimized using classical approach i.e. one-factor-at-a-time approach in previous work and
xylanase activity was increased to 570.0 U/g DBP. CMCase, avicelase, FPase and β-glucosidase
activities were not detected, highlighting the novelty of the xylanase enzyme produced by CKMX1.
Therefore, keeping in view the importance of statistical approach, an attempt has been made to
improve the production of xylanase using central composite design (CCD) following RSM with eight
independent variables as additional sources of carbon and nitrogen with apple pomace as cheap
agricultural waste by C. cellulans CKMX1 in SSF.

Materials and methods
Microorganism
Strain
 A bacterial culture isolated originally from mushroom compost and was characterized
by metabolic fingerprinting, whole-cell fatty acids methyl ester analysis and 16S rDNA and found to
be C. cellulans CKMX1. The 16S rDNA sequence of the strain has
been deposited in the GenBank database under accession number JN135476.

Culture and growth medium
The bacterial culture was grown and maintained in basal salt medium (BSM, pH 8.0)
containing 0.5 % xylan with the following composition (g/L):
Na2HPO4, 6.0;
KH2PO4, 3.0; NaCl, 0.5; NH4Cl,
1.0, 1 M MgSO4 (2 mL) and 1 M CaCl2 (0.1 mL). The
bacterial culture was maintained in 30 % glycerol at −20 °C.

Apple pomace as substrate
Apple pomace was procured from the processing unit of the Horticultural Produce
Marketing and Processing Corporation (HPMC; Parwanoo, Himachal Pradesh, India). The ovendried
material (60 °C for 48 h) was ground in an electric grinder and packed in air-tight containers for
subsequent studies.

Enzyme production and extraction
Solid-state fermentation was carried out in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing
10 g substrate (apple pomace) and 20 mL mineral salt solution (BSM) at pH 8.0 were autoclaved at 15
psi pressure for 20 min, cooled and inoculated with 2 mL bacterial suspension (OD 1.0 at
540 nm).After mixing, the flasks were incubated at 35 °C for 3 days. At the desired intervals, the
flasks were taken out, and the contents were extracted with 50 mL sterilized buffer (0.2 M, pH 8.0,
Tris HCl). The flasks were kept in shaker for half an hour to ensure thorough mixing of apple pomace
with the buffer. The flask contents were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The culture
supernatant was used as crude enzyme preparation (prior to centrifugation, samples were withdrawn
for determining viable number of cells by the standard viable plate count technique).

Enzyme assay
Xylanase activity was assayed using 1 % oat spelt xylan (Sigma, St, Louis, MO) in
0.2 M Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0) according to the calorimetric method of Miller (1959). The release of reducing sugars was determined using the
3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) method with a xylose standard curve. The reaction mixture contained
0.5 mL 1 % d-xylanin Tris–HCl buffer (0.2 M, pH 8.0) and
0.5 mL diluted enzyme. It was incubated at 50 °C for 5 min in a water bath with occasional shaking.
After incubation, 3 mL DNSA reagent was added into the test tubes, which also stopped the enzymatic
reaction. The tubes were immersed in boiling water bath and removed after 15 min when colour
development was completed. Tubes were cooled to room temperature. The contents were transferred to a
25 mL volumetric flask and final volume made up with distilled water. Optical density was read at
540 nm in a Spectronic-20.

One unit (IU) of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to
liberate 1 μmol reducing sugars per minute under given assay conditions. Xylanase activity is
expressed as U/g dry bacterial pomace (DBP).

Response surface methodology
Using the ‘one variable at a time’ approach, the effect of media types, particle
size of carbon source, incubation temperature, pH, incubation time, moisture level, inoculum size,
yeast extract, NH4NO3, peptone, urea, carboxymethyl
cellulose (CMC), Tween 20, CaCO3 and MgSO4 were
studied previously. Based on these experiments, eight independent variables were chosen for further
optimization by RSM using CCD experiments. The dependent variable selected for this study were the
enzyme activity, reducing sugar, viable count, pH, extracellular protein, specific activity and the
independent variables chosen were yeast extract (X1),
NH4NO3 (X2), peptone
(X3), urea (X4), CMC (X5),
Tween 20 (X6), CaCO3 (X7) and
MgSO4 (X8). Each variable was studied at three levels
(−1, 0, +1). The range and the levels of these variables are given in Table 2. The experimental design included 51 flasks with three replicates at
their central coded values (Chadha et al. 2004). The
mathematical relationship of response (enzyme production) and variable X1,
X2, X3, X4,
X5, X6, X7 and
X8 was approximated by a quadratic model equation. The response value in each
trial is the average of triplicate experiments.

Central composite design
RSM was used to optimize the fermentation parameters for enhancing xylanase
production. RSM has four steps: procedures to move into the optimum region, behaviour of the
response in the optimum region, estimation of the optimal condition and verification (Tanyildizi et
al. 2005). A CCD (Box and Wilson 1951; Coman and Bahrim 2011) was employed in this study. According to the CCD, the total number of
experimental combinations is 2k + 2k + n0, where k is the number of independent
variables and n0 is the number of repetitions of the experiments at the centre point. For
statistical calculation, the experimental variables Xi have been coded as xi according to the following transformation equation xi=Xi-X0δX where xi is the dimensionless coded value of the variable Xi, X0 is the value of Xi at the centre point, and δX is the step
change.

In this study, the CCD with eight factors and three levels, including three
replicates at the centre point, was used for fitting a second order response surface.
Table 2 gives the factors and their values, respectively.
This methodology allows the modelling of a second order equation that describes the process.
Xylanase production was analysed by multiple regression through the least squares method to fit the
following equation: Y=A0+∑AiXi+∑AiiXi+∑AijXiXj where Y is the predicted response variable; A0, Ai, Aii, Aij are constant regression coefficients of the
model, and Xi, Xj (i = 1, 3; j = 1, 3, i ≠ j) represent the independent
variables (medium composition) in the form of coded values. The accuracy and general ability of the
above polynomial model could be evaluated by the coefficient of determination R2. Each experimental design was carried out in triplicate, and the mean
values were given.

Statistical analysis
The statistical software package Design-Expert 8.0.4 (StatEase, Minneapolis, MN)
was used for regression analysis of experimental data to obtain working parameters and to generate
response surface graphs. ANOVA was used to estimate statistical parameters.

Results
Regression model of response
In this method, prior knowledge obtained from a previous experiment i.e.
one-factor-at-a-time approach (understanding of the cultivation condition variables under
investigation) was necessary for achieving a more realistic model (Data not shown).
Table 1 shows the maximum and minimum levels of variables
chosen for trials (Run) in the CCD. For RSM based on the CCD, used for the optimization of
independent variables for the xylanase production, 51 experimental runs with different combinations
of eight factors were carried out. The variables used for the factorial analysis were yeast extract
(X1), ammonium nitrate (X2), peptone
(X3), urea nitrogen (X4), CMC
(X5), Tween 20 (X6), CaCO3
(X7) and MgSO4 (X8). The range
and the levels of these variables are given in Table 2. The
experimental responses for the 51 runs are presented in Table 2, which shows considerable variation in the amount of xylanase production depending
on the eight independent variables in the medium.Table 1 Coded values of independent variables at different levels used in central composite

As shown in Table 2, the minimum and
maximum xylanase production obtained was 331.50 U/g DBP and 1027.65 U/g DBP, respectively. The
highest xylanase activity was obtained from Run No. 30, which consisted of Yeast extract, 1.00 g
(%); NH4NO3, 0.20 g (%); Peptone, 1.00 g (%); Urea
nitrogen, 10 mg (%); CMC, 1.00 g (%); Tween 20, 0.02 mL (%); CaCO3, 0.50 g
(%) and MgSO4, 9.0 g (%); while the lowest activity was obtained in Run No.
33, which consisted of Yeast extract, 0.60 g (%);
NH4NO3, 0.60 g (%); Peptone, 0.60 g (%); Urea
nitrogen, 30 mg (%); CMC, 3.0 g (%); Tween 20, 0.02 mL (%); CaCO3, 1.00 g (%)
and MgSO4, 5.00 g (%). Other responses observed for maximum xylanase
production (Run No. 30) are reducing sugars, 770.74 mg/mL/g; protein, 80.68 mg/mL; specific
activity, 12.73 U/mg protein; viable count, 236.0 × 105 cfu/mL and final
pH 5.95, while for minimum xylanase production the other responses are reducing sugars,
248.63 mg/mL/g; protein, 65.69 mg/mL; specific activity, 5.05 U/mg protein; viable count,
144 × 105 cfu/mL and final pH 5.96. Treatment runs were repeated three
times for estimation of error. This result suggests that the data were deviated and the flask
experiments were accurate. In general, the highest xylanase activity was obtained in medium
supplemented with high level of yeast extract, peptone and MgSO4.

By applying multiple regression analysis on the experimental data, the following
quadratic model was generated for the response of xylanase activity. The significant model terms
were evaluated by ANOVA in the optimization study (Table 3)

yeast extract, X2 is NH4NO3,
X3 is peptone, X4 is urea nitrogen,
X5 is CMC, X6 is Tween 20, X7
is CaCO3 and X8 is
MgSO4.

The statistical significance of Eq. (1) was
checked by F test, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the
response surface quadratic model is shown in Table 3. It is
evident that the model was highly significant, as suggested by the model F value and a low probability value [(P model
> F = 0.0001)]. The ANOVA (F test) shows that the second model was well adjusted to the experimental data. The
coefficient of variation (CV) indicates the degree of precision with which the treatments were
compared. Usually, the higher the value of CV, the lower the reliability of experiment is. Here, a
lower value of CV (4.13) indicated a better precision and reliability of the experiments. The
precision of a model can be checked by the determination coefficient (R2) and correlation coefficient (R).
The determination coefficient (R2) implies that the sample variation of 97.59 % for xylanase production
was attributed to the independent variables, and only about 2.41 % of the total variation cannot be
explained by the model. Normally, a regression model having an R
value higher than 0.9 is considered to have a very high correlation. The closer the value of
R (correlation coefficient) to 1, the better the correlation
between the experimental and predicted values. Here, the value of R (0.9971) for Eq. (1) indicates a close
agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical values predicted by the model
equation. Linear and quadratic terms were both significant at the 1 % level. Therefore, the
quadratic model was selected in this optimization study.

The Student t distribution and the corresponding
P value, along with the parameter estimate, are given in
Table 3. The P values are
used as a tool to check the significance of each of the coefficients which, in turn, are necessary
to understand the pattern of the mutual interactions between the best variables. The smaller the
P values, the bigger the significance of the corresponding
coefficient. The parameter estimates and the corresponding P
values suggests that, among the independent variables, X1 (yeast extract),
X2 (NH4NO3),
X3 (peptone), X6 (Tween 20), X7
(CaCO3) and X8 (MgSO4) have a
significant effect on xylanase production. The positive coefficients for X3,
X4 and X7 indicate a linear effect to increase
xylanase production, while negative coefficient for X1,
X2 and X8 shows a linear effect to decrease xylanase
production. The quadric term of these variables also had a significant effect except X32, X52 and X72. However, no interactions between the X1X7,
X1X8,
X2X3,
X2X8,
X3X6,
X3X8,
X4X6,

Comparison of observed and predicted xylanase activity
A regression model can be used to predict future observations on the response Y
(xylanase activity) corresponding to particular values of the regressor variables. In predicting new
observations and in estimating the mean response at a given point, one must be careful about
extrapolating beyond the region containing the original observations. It is possible that a model
that fits well in the region of the original data will no longer fit well outside the region.
Figure 1 shows observed xylanase activity (the response)
versus those from the empirical model Eq. (1). Figure proves
the predicted data of the response from the empirical model is in agreement with the observed ones
in the range of the operating variables.Fig. 1 Observed xylanase activity versus the predicted xylanase activity under different
fermentation conditions



Localization of optimum conditions
The 3D response surface plots described by the regression model were drawn to
illustrate the effects of the independent variables on the response variables. The shape of the
corresponding contour indicates whether the mutual interactions between the independent variables
are significant or not. An elliptical nature of the contour plots indicates that the interactions
between the independent variables are significant. From the 3D response surface plots and the
corresponding contour plots, the optimal values of the independent variables could be observed, and
the interaction between each independent variable’s pair can be easily understood.

Figure 2 depicts the 3D plot and its
corresponding contour plot, showing the effects of ammonium nitrate concentration and peptone on the
xylanase production, while all other six factors were fixed at its middle level. Figure 2 indicates the yield of the xylanase production decreased gradually as
the ammonium nitrate concentration increased at a low concentration of peptone. With the increase in
the concentration of peptone at its high level, xylanase production significantly increased from
523.02 U/g DBP to 900 U/g DBP at a low initial ammonium nitrate concentration. This suggests that
increasing the concentration of peptone within the tested range was beneficial to the accumulation
of xylanase production. Our results also show that the increasing of ammonium nitrate concentration
beyond 0.20 g (%) decreased the xylanase production.Fig. 2 Response surface plot and contour plot of the combined effects of ammonium nitrate and
peptone on the xylanase production by C. cellulans
CKMX1



Figure 3 presents 3D plot and its
corresponding contour plot showing the effects of yeast extract and Tween 20 on the xylanase
production, while all other six factors were fixed at its middle level. It is evidence that the
yield of xylanase production increased simultaneously when both yeast extract and Tween 20
concentration increased, but above 0.60 g (%) concentration of yeast extract xylanase production
decreased at a low Tween 20 concentration. This phenomenon was more pronounced when Tween 20 was set
at high level and yeast extract was set at middle level, resulting in the change of xylanase
production from 400 to 681.81 U/g DBP.Fig. 3 Response surface plot and contour plot of the combined effects of yeast extract and
Tween 20 on the xylanase production by C. cellulans
CKMX1



Figure 4 shows the effects of yeast extract
and MgSO4 on the xylanase production, while all other six factors were fixed
at its middle level. When the yeast extract concentration of the cultivation medium was near
neutral, increasing the MgSO4 concentration to some extent favoured the
xylanase production. However, with the increase in the concentration of yeast extract near to
neutral, the xylanase production significantly increased from 500 to 765.49 U/g DBP at a low
MgSO4 concentration. Under this circumstance, the optimum yeast extract
concentration and MgSO4 concentration were 0.5 g (%) and 3.0 g (%),
respectively. However, the xylanase production gradually decreased when yeast extract concentration
exceeded optimal conditions 0.5 g (%). This indicated that, under optimal yeast extract and
MgSO4 concentration, an increase in yeast extract concentration would not
further increase the yield of xylanase production. These facts were important in making the whole
process economically more feasible.Fig. 4 Response surface plot and contour plot of the combined effects of yeast extract and
MgSO4 on the xylanase production by C.
cellulans CKMX1



Model adequacy checking
Usually, it is necessary to check the fitted model to ensure that it provides an
adequate approximation to the real system. Unless the model shows an adequate fit, proceeding with
the investigation and optimization of the fitted response surface likely give poor or misleading
results. The residuals from the least squares fit play an important role in judging model adequacy.
By constructing a normal probability plot of the residuals, a check was made for the normality
assumption, as given in Fig. 5. The normality assumption was
satisfied as the residual plot approximated along a straight line. Figure 6 presents a plot of residuals versus the predicted response. The general impression
is that the residuals scatter randomly on the display, suggesting that the variance of the original
observation is constant for all values of predicted response (Y). Both of the plots
(Figs. 5, 6) are
satisfactory, so we conclude that the empirical model is adequate to describe the xylanase activity
by response surface.Fig. 5 Normal probability of internally studentized residuals

Fig. 6 Plot of internally studentized residuals versus predicted response



Validation of the model
The statistical optimal values of variables were obtained when moving along the
major and minor axis of the contour, and the response at low and high level yielded maximum xylanase
production. These observations were also verified from canonical analysis of the response surface.
The canonical analysis revealed a minimum region for the model. The stationary point presenting a
maximum xylanase activity had the following critical values: yeast extract 1.00 g (%), ammonium
nitrate 0.22 g (%), peptone 0.91 g (%), urea nitrogen 17.95 mg (%), CMC 4.91 g (%), Tween 20 0.24 mL
(%), CaCO3 0.66 g (%) and MgSO4 7.47 g (%). The
predicted xylanase activity for these conditions was 1063.50 U/g DBP.

A repeat fermentation of xylanase by C.
cellulans CKMX1 under optimal conditions was carried out for verification of the
optimization. The maximal xylanase level obtained was 1050.24 U/g DBP. This value was found to be
4.07 % less than the predicted value. This discrepancy might be due to the slight variation in
experimental conditions. The optimization resulted in 3.1- fold increase of xylanase production,
compared with the lowest xylanase production of 331.50 U/g DBP.

Application of cellulase-free xylanase in pulp biobleaching by C.
cellulans CKMX1
The kappa number (Tasman and Berzins 1957) of enzyme pre-treated wheat straw pulp was lower than control. At an enzyme
dosage of 0.2 and 0.5 %, the enzymatic pre-treatment decreased kappa number by 0.9 points or 7.69 %
and 1.4 points or 11.96 %, respectively, as compared with control. In addition to this, enzymatic
pre-treatment of 0.2 % of pulp increases the brightness points to 1.1 % ISO, while enzyme dose of
0.5 % of pulp increases the brightness points to 2.2 % ISO. Cellulase-free xylanase from C. cellulans CKMX1 under C–EP–D sequence has been shown to bring about a
6.10 % reduction or savings of chlorine in 0.2 % enzyme treated pulp and 12.5 % reduction or savings
of chlorine in 0.5 % enzyme treated pulp as compared to control treatment where no enzyme
pre-treatment was given, when enzymatically prebleached pulp was charged with 7.4 % of total
chlorine. Decrease of 0.5 kappa points or 25 % was observed in treatment where enzyme dose was 0.2 %
of pulp, and decrease of 0.8 kappa points or 40 % was found in enzyme treatment of 0.5 % of pulp as
compared to control. Paper sheets were prepared using 60 g of pulp on OD basis. Enzyme dose of 0.2 %
of pulp increased brightness to 84.71 % ISO points and enzyme dose of 0.5 % of pulp increased the
brightness to 85.2 % ISO points as compared to control treatment where brightness was observed to be
83.78 % ISO points. Gain in brightness points was 0.93 % ISO in enzymatic treatment of 0.2 % of pulp
and 1.42 % ISO points in enzymatic treatment of 0.5 % of pulp.

Discussion
Nowadays, there is growing acceptance of the use of statistical experimental
designs in biotechnology to optimize culture medium components and conditions (Khucharoenphaisan et
al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008; Coman and Bahrim 2011). Many
studies have reported satisfactory optimization of xylanase production from microbial sources using
a statistical approach (Silva and Roberto 2001; Li et
al. 2007a, b; Coman and Bahrim 2011). RSM and CCD
were employed to optimize a fermentation medium for the production of xylanase by C. cellulans CKMX1 at pH 8.0. The optimization resulted in 3.1-fold
increase of xylanase production, compared with the lowest xylanase production of 331.50 U/g DBP
(Table 2). Dobrev et al. 2006 also showed that the xylanase activity obtained with the optimized nutrient
medium is 33 % higher than the activity, achieved with the basic medium. The application of
statistical design for screening and optimization of culture conditions for the production of
xylanolytic enzymes allows quick identification of the important factors and the interactions
between them (Katapodis et al. 2007; Vasconcelos et al.
2000). The RSM applied to the optimization of xylanase
production in this investigation suggested the importance of a variety of factors at different
levels. A high degree of similarity was observed between the predicted and experimental values,
which reflected the accuracy and applicability of RSM to optimize the process for enzyme production
(Techapun et al. 2002; Vasconcelos et al. 2000). The ANOVA (F test) shows
that the second model was well adjusted to the experimental data. The CV indicates the degree of
precision with which the treatments were compared (Wang et al. 2008; Vasconcelos et al. 2000). Usually,
the higher the value of CV, the lower the reliability of experiment is. Here, a lower value of CV
(4.13) indicated a better precision and reliability of the experiments. The precision of a model can
be checked by the determination coefficient (R2) and correlation coefficient (R).
The determination coefficient (R2) implies that the sample variation of 97.59 % for xylanase production
was attributed to the independent variables, and only about 2.41 % of the total variation cannot be
explained by the model (Table 3). Normally, a regression
model having an R2 value higher than 0.9 is considered to have a very high correlation.
The closer the value of R (correlation coefficient) to 1, the
better the correlation between the experimental and predicted values (Li et al. 2007b). Here, the value of R
(0.9971) for Eq. (1) indicates a close agreement between the
experimental results and the theoretical values predicted by the model equation. Linear and
quadratic terms were both significant at the 1 % level. Therefore, the quadratic model was selected
in this optimization study. There have been reports on optimization of culture media using
statistical approaches for a few bacterial xylanases processes but not for cellulase-free,
alkali-stable xylanases in SSF of apple pomace (Li et al. 2007a, b). The statistical optimization
approach is efficient and has been applied successfully to SSFs that have overcome the limitations
of classical empirical methods (Yu et al. 1997; Ellouze
et al. 2008). A response surface method with
three-factor-three-level design has been used to optimize the medium components and its pH, for
maximum xylanase production by Bacillus circulans D1 in submerged
fermentation (SmF), which resulted in a maximum concentration of 22.45 U/mL (Bocchini et al.
2002; Senthilkumar et al. 2005). Similarly, xylanase production by Schizophyllum
commune and Thermomyces lanuginosus has been maximized
by CCRD method, and the maximum xylanase yields were 5.74 and 2.7 U/mL, respectively, in SmF
(Haltrich et al. 1993; Purkarthofer et al. 1993). The results of CCD indicate the significance of yeast extract
(X1), NH4NO3
(X2), peptone (X3), Tween 20
(X6), CaCO3 (X7), and
MgSO4 (X8) on production of xylanase by C. cellulans CKMX1. Despite some interactions, maximum interactions of
different variables i.e. X1,X2,
X3, X6, X7,
X8, X1X2,

X1X4,

Biobleaching processes require xylanases that are active at higher temperature and
alkaline pH. The crude xylanase from C. cellulans CKMX1 showed
high thermostability (up to 60 °C) over a broad pH range (5–10).The study of the physical and
chemical properties of a pulp prebleached with enzyme charge of 0.2 and 0.5 % pulp for 2 h before
chemical bleaching treatment revealed an increase in the brightness points by 1.1 and 2.2 % ISO and
an increase in residual chlorine by 6.10 and 12.5 %. In a previous study using 10 IU/g commercial
xylanase P, the control level of brightness was retained at 23.3, 30 and 16.7 %
ClO2 reduction for bagasse, soda-aq, and Kraft pulps, respectively (Madlala
et al. 2001). In another study, the use of commercial
xylanases Novozyme 473 and VAI-Xylanase increased brightness of Kraft pulp by 2.5 points at 31 %
ClO2 reduction (Bajpai et al. 1994; Singh et al. 2013). The
effectiveness of xylanase treatment before chemical bleaching application may be due to cleavage of
either the linkage of residual lignin to hemicellulose, leading to increased accessibility of the
pulp to bleaching chemicals and enhanced extraction of lignin, or target substrate modification
during subsequent bleaching stages (Ninawe and Kuhad 2006; Azeri et al. 2010).

Conclusion
Statistical optimization of cultivation conditions using the central composite
appeared to be a valuable tool for the production of xylanase by C.
cellulans CKMX1. The predicted and actual xylanase activity under optimal conditions in
stationary flasks experiments were 1041.93 U/g DBP and 1027.65 U/g DBP, respectively. A scale-up of
the fermentation process was carried out in a aluminium trays to reconfirm the maximum xylanase
activity of 1150.37 U/g DBP after 72 h cultivation under optimized conditions. Cellulase-free
xylanase from C. cellulans CKMX1 under
C–EP–D sequence has been shown to bring about a 12.5 % reduction of chlorine,
decrease of 0.8 kappa points (40 %) and gain in brightness was 1.42 % ISO points in 0.5 % enzyme
treated pulp as compared to control where no enzyme pre-treatment was given, when enzymatically
prebleached pulp was charged with 7.4 % of total chlorine. From the present studies, it is clear
that C. cellulans CKMX1 xylanase is having the characteristic
suited for an industrial enzyme.

The biodegradation of pendimethalin by freely suspended and the immobilized cells of B. lehensis on various matrices namely agar, alginate, polyacrylamide, and polyurethane foam was also investigated. The batch degradation rate was nearly the same for both free and immobilized cells in agar and alginate, whereas polyacrylamide- and PUF-immobilized cells degraded 93 and 100 of 0.1 % pendimethalin after 96 and 72 h, respectively. At higher concentration, the degradation rate of freely suspended cells decreased; whereas the same immobilized cells on polyurethane foam completely degraded 0.2 % pendimethalin within 96 h. The repeated batch degradation with the polyurethane foam-immobilized cells was reused for 35 cycles without losing the 0.1 % pendimethalin degrading ability. In contrast, agar-, alginate- and polyacrylamide-immobilized cells could be reused for 15, 18, and 25 cycles, respectively. When the pendimethalin concentration was increased to 0.2 %, the immobilized cells could be reused but the pendimethalin degradation rate was decreased. Polyurethane foam-immobilized cells exhibited better tolerance to pH and temperature alterations than freely suspended cells and could be stored for more than 3 months without losing pendimethalin degrading ability. The immobilization of cells capable of degrading pendimethalin may serve as an ideal technique for the complete degradation of the herbicide in the environment.

Introduction
Microorganisms are one of the tools used to detoxify toxic compounds present in the environment. Free suspended or immobilized microbial cells can be used for this purpose. However, the immobilized microbial cells have many advantages over free suspended cells under different conditions. For instance, the immobilization of whole cells increases degradation rate owing to increased cell population density, cell wall permeability, and extracellular microbial enzymes stability are improved, cells can be easily removed from the reaction mixture, higher operational stability and storage stability, reuse of immobilized cells in continuous reactors, and allows the bioreactors to operate at flow rates different from the growth rate of the microorganisms (Bettmann and Rehm 1984; Hall and Rao 1989; Cassidy et al. 1996; Ha et al. 2009; Zheng et al. 2009). In addition, the immobilized cell systems act as a protective cover in the presence of toxic compounds and are more resistant to pH or temperature changes. However, free suspended cells have better mass transfer aspects compared to immobilized bacterial or fungal cells (Trevors et al. 1992; Zheng et al. 2009).

In the last two decades, there have been intensive researches on the use of immobilized microbial cells as biocatalysts, using numerous reactors like fed batch, semi-continuous fed batch, and continuous packed bed reactor. Each reactor type possesses its disadvantages and advantages, and the choice of a particular type of a reactor may depend on the operational conditions, and inexpensive and non-toxic support inert material for microbial cell immobilization, etc., (Zheng et al. 2009). Bacterial cells immobilized on various matrices have been used extensively for biodegradation of various toxic nitroaromatics such as trinitrotoluene (TNT) (Rho et al. 2001; Ullah et al. 2010), nitrobenzene (Zheng et al. 2009; Qi et al. 2012), 2-nitrotoluene (Mulla et al. 2013), and 3-nitrobenzoate (Mulla et al. 2012).

Pendimethalin [N-(1-ethyl propyl) 2,6-dinitro-3,4-xylidine], a common water and soil contaminant, herbicide of dinitroaniline group, is used to control weeds in various crop plants. The use of pendimethalin may adversely affect endangered species of terrestrial and semi-aquatic plants and invertebrates (Kole et al. 1994). One of the best strategies to degrade the hazardous compounds (including pendimethalin) is to use microorganisms. There are few reports on the degradation of pendimethalin by free cells of Fusarium oxysporum and Paecilomyces variotii (Singh and Kulshrestha 1991), Azotobacter chroococcum (Kole et al. 1994), Bacillus circulans (Megadi et al. 2010), and fungus Lecanicillium saksenae (Pinto et al. 2012). However, there is no report on the degradation of pendimethalin by immobilized bacterial or fungal cells. The aim of the present investigation was therefore to compare the pendimethalin degradation by freely suspended and immobilized cells of Bacillus lehensis XJU on various matrices in batch and semi-continuous degradation, and to evaluate the effect of pH, temperature, and storage stability of pendimethalin degradation rate by polyurethane foam (PUF)-immobilized bacterial cells.

Materials and methods
Chemicals and reagents
Pendimethalin was a generous gift from Rallis Agrochemicals India Ltd. (Mumbai, India). The 6-aminopendimethalin and 3,4-dimethyl 2,6-dinitroaniline standards were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, USA). Polyurethane foam and nylon meshes were purchased from Merck Specialities Private Limited (Mumbai, India). Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, ammonium persulfate, sodium alginate (SA), nutrient agar, agar–agar, sodium chloride, and calcium chloride were purchased from HiMedia Laboratories (Mumbai, India). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and available commercially.

Isolation and identification of the bacterium
The bacterium was isolated from the contaminated soil samples by enrichment cultures with pendimethalin as a sole carbon source. It was identified based on morphological and biochemical aspects, as well as based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. It was maintained on mineral salt (Seubert 1960) agar slants containing 0.1 % (w/v) pendimethalin.

Isolation and identification of the metabolites of pendimethalin degradation by the isolate
The mineral salt medium (Seubert 1960) containing 0.1 % (w/v) pendimethalin was used as the production medium. The inoculated flasks were incubated on an orbital incubator (Model S150, Stuart, India) regulated at 150 rev/min for 24 h at room temperature (30 ± 2 °C). The bacterial growth was turbidometrically followed at 660 nm. The culture filtrate was collected by centrifugation, and ethyl acetate was used to extract the end products of pendimethalin degradation from the culture supernatant. The methanol was utilized to dissolve the residue from extraction. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel G plates was used to analyze the residue for the presence of metabolites, using various solvent mixtures. An aqueous solution of FeCl3–K3Fe(CN)6 was used to visualize the metabolites after exposure to I2 vapors. The metabolites were also quantified by reversed-phase HPLC with a 5 µ spherisorb ODS (C18) column (250 × 4.6 mm). The mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and 50 mM phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 in the (70: 30, v/v) ratio. The flow rate was 1 mL/min, and the peaks were detected at 254 nm. UV–visible spectrophotometer was used to record the metabolites absorbance spectra. The metabolites were also further subjected to mass spectral studies (JEOL DX303).

Media used for the degradation studies
Two different media were used for this study. The mineral salt medium (MM1) consisting of (g/l) K2HPO4 (6.30), KH2PO4 (1.83), NH4NO3 (1.00), MgSO4· 7H2O (0.10), CaCl2·2H2O (0.10), FeSO4·7H2O (0.10), Na2MoO4·2H2O (0.005), and MnSO4· H2O (0.10) was used for the pre-cultivation of the bacterium. The medium was filtered and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. The medium was then dispersed in 100 mL quantities in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks and sterilized by autoclaving for 15 min at 15 psi. After sterilization by membrane filtration, pendimethalin was supplemented to the cultivation medium before bacterial inoculation. For the degradation studies, the mineral salt medium (MM2) comprising (g/l) K2HPO4 (6.30), NH4NO3(1.00), MgSO4·7H2O (0.20), CaCl2·2H2O (0.20), and FeCl3 (0.05) was used. The medium was filtered and the pH was adjusted to 7.0. The medium was then dispersed in 100 mL quantities in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks and sterilized by autoclaving for 15 min at 15 psi; 0.1/0.2 % (w/v) pendimethalin was then added after MM2 sterilization. The bacterial cultures were then incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 150 rpm. The plate count method was used to find out the bacterial cell concentration.

Immobilization of bacterial cells in various matrices
Bacillus lehensis XJU was grown in the MM1 containing pendimethalin. During the mid-logarithmic growth, the bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000×g for 10 min at 15 °C, and washed two times with phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) of 50 mM strength. Alginate, agar, polyacrylamide (PA), and polyurethane foam (PUF) were then used as inert materials to immobilize the bacterial cells.

A procedure proposed by Bettmann and Rehm (1984) was used for sodium alginate entrapment of bacterial cells. 4 % (w/v) sodium alginate was mixed with 100 mL of distilled and autoclaved for 15 min. For biodegradation investigation, 20 g of wet bacterial cells was dissolved in 50 mL of MM2. The resulted suspension of B. lehensis XJU cells was mixed with 200 mL of alginate solution and stirred well with a magnetic stirrer. A combination of sodium alginate-bacterial cells was then added drop wise to a cold 0.2 M CaCl2 solution with a burette. The formed gel beds of about 2.5 mm diameter were hardened for 5 h by re-suspending into a freshly sterile solution of CaCl2 solution, and then frozen overnight at −18 °C. The beds were finally washed many times with sterilized distilled water and used for further studies.

The method proposed by Jonathan (1988) was followed for agar entrapment of bacterial cells. 4.5 mL of 0.9 % NaCl (w/v) was mixed with 100 mg of agar and heated at 100 °C till complete dissolution. The mixture was then cooled down at 40 °C. A slurry of B. lehensis XJU cells was taken and dissolved in 0.9 % (w/v) NaCl solution. 4.5 mL of the agar solution was mixed with 0.5 mL of bacterial cell slurry, poured on the nylon net placed on the glass plate, and cooled down to 5 °C. The 0.1 M phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 was used to store nylon membrane until used.

Jonathan (1988) method was also used for bacterial cells immobilization in polyacrylamide. 10 mL of distilled water was mixed with 15 g of wet bacterial cells and chilled in ice. 2.85 g acrylamide, 0.15 g bisacrylamide, and 10 mg ammonium persulfate were dissolved in chilled 10 mL of 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The bacterial cell suspension was immediately mixed with the buffer solution, poured into Petri plates, and allowed to polymerize for 1 h. 100 mL of 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was used to suspend the resulted sieved gels and allowed to settle down. After decantation, the gel was ready for degradation investigations.

Hall and Rao (1989) method was followed for polyurethane foam (PUF) immobilization. The PUF was cut into 5 mm cubes, washed with distilled water two times, and then dried. 4 g sterile foam cubes were placed in 100 mL of bacterial cell suspensions (9 × 109 cfu/mL) contained in 500-mL Erlenmeyer flasks, mixed for 2 h with the help of magnetic stirrer, and shaken for 1 h at 150 rpm. The conical flasks were left undistributed for 2 more hours. After medium removal, a saline solution was used to wash the immobilized foam cubes for further studies.

Pendimethalin degradation conditions
The batch degradations were carried out for both freely and immobilized B. lehensis XJU cells in four matrices. 3 mL of heat-killed cells along with 3 mL of freely suspended exponentially growing cells was added to 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 97 mL mineral salts medium (MM2) with different amount of substrates (0.1 and 0.2 %, w/v). For immobilized B. lehensis XJU cells, 11 g wet beads/foam cubes of the four matrices were supplemented to a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL of mineral salts medium (MM2) with 0.1/0.2 % pendimethalin. The cell population in various matrices was in the 1.0 to 1.3 × 1010 cfu/g beads/foam cubes range. The degradation process by free and immobilized cells was carried out at room temperature (30 °C) on a rotary shaker (150 rpm). The various samples from culture medium were extracted at regular intervals for analysis of the residual substrate pendimethalin by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

To evaluate the longevity of degrading activity of immobilized bacterial cells in various matrices, repetitive batch degradations were carried out. After each cycle of incubation period (96 h/cycle), the spent medium was decanted and beads/foam cubes were washed with double distilled water and transferred into a fresh MM2 medium containing pendimethalin. The degradation process was carried out under identical conditions and spent medium was used for the residual pendimethalin analysis by HPLC.

Effect of pH and temperature on the pendimethalin degradation by freely suspended and PUF-immobilized cells
The rate of degradation of pendimethalin by freely suspended cells and PUF-immobilized cells of B. lehensis XJU at different pH (4.0–10.0) and temperatures (20–45 °C) was measured after 96 h of incubation.

Storage stability of freely suspended and PUF-immobilized bacterial cells in degrading pendimethalin
The storage stability of both free suspended and PUF-immobilized cells was evaluated at 4 °C every 10 days for a period 90 days.

Analytical methods
The pendimethalin in the spent medium was quantified by reversed-phase HPLC with a 5 µ spherisorb ODS (C18) column (250 × 4.6 mm). The mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and 50 mM phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 in the (70: 30, v/v) ratio. The flow rate was 1 mL/min and the peaks were detected at 254 nm.

Statistical analysis
Three independent experiments were conducted to evaluate pendimethalin degradation by freely suspended and immobilized bacterial cells. The means were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and means for groups in homogeneous subsets were given by Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT) at the 5 % significance level. The SPSS statistical package (PASW Statistics 18) was utilized for all statistical evaluations.

Results
Biodegradation of pendimethalin by Bacillus lehensis XJU
The bacterium isolated from the contaminated soil samples by enrichment cultures with pendimethalin as a sole carbon source was identified as B. lehensis XJU based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis (GenBank Accession Number: AY793550). The analysis of metabolites of the culture filtrates of B. lehensis XJU grown on pendimethalin showed the presence of two compounds whose chromatographic and spectral values corresponded well with that of authentic 3,4-dimethyl 2,6-dinitroaniline and 6-aminopendimethalin (Table 1).Table 1 Chromatographic and spectral properties of metabolites resulted from pendimethalin degradation by Bacillus lehensis XJU

Degradation of pendimethalin by freely suspended and immobilized cells of Bacillus lehensis XJU in batch cultures
Batch degradation on shaken cultures with B. lehensis XJU showed that increasing concentration of pendimethalin was better tolerated and quickly degraded by immobilized cells than by free organisms. At low concentration (0.1 % w/v), the degradation rate was nearly the same for both free and immobilized cells in agar, alginate, and polyacrylamide after 96 h, with complete degradation in bacterial cells immobilized in PUF after 72 h (Fig. 1). However, with increasing concentration (0.2 % w/v), the degradation rate of free cells decreased and 20 % pendimethalin was only degraded; whereas the same immobilized cells in agar, alginate, and polyacrylamide matrices degraded 50–77 %. A complete degradation of pendimethalin was also observed for cells immobilized in PUF but within 96 h (Fig. 2). At the concentration of 0.7 % w/v, pendimethalin was not degraded by free cells, but was degraded by PUF-immobilized cells (data not shown), which were more effective than cells immobilized in agar, alginate, and polyacrylamide.Fig. 1 Batch culture degradation of 0.1 % pendimethalin by cells of Bacillus lehensis XJU immobilized on polyurethane foam (PUF, filled circle), polyacrylamide (PA, filled square), sodium alginate (SA, open circle), agar (filled triangle), and by free suspended cells (filled square).

The uninoculated culture served as control (filled diamond)



Semi-continuous degradation of pendimethalin by immobilized cells of B. lehensis XJU
The degradation of pendimethalin by cells immobilized in polyurethane foam (PUF), alginate, agar, and polyacrylamide was carried out at different concentrations of pendimethalin (0.1 and 0.2 %) for 96 h. The polyurethane foam (PUF)-immobilized cells were reused for 35 cycles without losing the pendimethalin degrading capacity when the initial concentration of pendimethalin was 0.1 %. In contrast, agar-, alginate-, and polyacrylamide-immobilized cells were reused for 15, 18, and 25 cycles, respectively, (Fig. 3). When the initial concentration of pendimethalin was increased to 0.2 %, the immobilized cells could be reused but the rate of degradation of pendimethalin was decreased (Fig. 4).Fig. 3 Semi-continuous degradation of pendimethalin (0.1 %) by cells of Bacillus lehensis XJU immobilized on polyurethane foam (PUF, filled diamond), polyacrylamide (PA, filled square), sodium alginate (SA, filled triangle), and agar (filled circle)

Effect of pH on pendimethalin degradation rate by PUF-immobilized bacterial cells
The effect of pH on degradation rates of pendimethalin by immobilized cells on PUF and free suspended cells was investigated in the pH 4.0–10.0 range. The initial pH alteration in the 6.0 and 8.0 range had no effect on the pendimethalin degradation by PUF-immobilized cells. A slight degradation rate was observed at pH 4.0, 9.0, and 10.0. However, freely suspended cells were active at pH 7.0, and other pH below or above 7.0 had adverse effects on both degradation rate and organism growth (Fig. 5).Fig. 5 Effect of pH on the degradation of 0.1 % pendimethalin by freely suspended (open square) and PUF-immobilized (filled square) Bacillus lehensis XJU cells.

Effect of temperature on pendimethalin degradation rate by PUF-immobilized bacterial cells
The effect of temperature on the degradation of pendimethalin by PUF-immobilized cells was analyzed. The pendimethalin degradation was seen in the 20–45 °C range with optimum at 30 °C, although statistically at par with 25, 35, and 40 °C for immobilized bacterial cells. However, the temperatures below and above 30 °C were not suitable for degradation of pendimethalin by freely suspended cells (Fig. 6).Fig. 6 Influence of temperature on the 0.1 % pendimethalin degradation by freely suspended cells (open square) and PUF-immobilized Bacillus lehensis XJU cells (filled square). The pendimethalin degradation values with different numbers or alphabets on the error bars significantly differ from each other at P

Storage stability of the PUF-immobilized cells degrading pendimethalin
PUF-immobilized cells were stored at 4 °C for 90 days and no decline in degradation ability observed for 50 days, and a marginal decrease of less than 10 % was observed after 90 days. However, a significant gradual decrease in pendimethalin degradation ability was seen with freely suspended bacterial cells and no degradation observed after 3 months (Fig. 7).Fig. 7 Storage stability of freely suspended (filled diamond) and PUF-immobilized (filled square) Bacillus lehensis XJU cells grown on 0.1 % pendimethalin.

Discussion
The degradation of pendimethalin by B. lehensis XJU based on TLC, reverse phase HPLC, UV visible, and mass spectral studies has resulted in the formation of 3,4-dimethyl 2,6-dinitroaniline and 6-aminopendimethalin. Similarly, the biodegradation of the herbicide pendimethalin by B. circulans, resulted in the formation of two metabolites, viz., 6-aminopendimethalin by pendimethalin reduction, and 3,4-dimethyl 2,6-dinitroaniline by pendimethalin oxidative dealkylation (Megadi et al. 2010). Biodegradation of pendimethalin by freely suspended cells of B. lehensis XJU and by cells immobilized in agar, SA, PUF, and polyacrylamide was compared with respect to their degradation rate and tolerance against increasing concentrations of pendimethalin. In batch cultures, the freely suspended cells degraded pendimethalin comparatively well at lower concentrations (0.1 %) and degradation rate decreased at higher concentrations. The cells immobilized in SA, PUF, agar, and polyacrylamide matrices were able to survive and degrade pendimethalin at higher concentrations. The cells immobilized in PUF degraded pendimethalin up to the concentration of 0.7 % (w/v) in batch cultures. The present results revealed that the toxicity of pendimethalin at high concentration level could inhibit the metabolism resulting in lower removal efficiency by the free cells. In addition, it indicates that in an immobilized cell culture, the carrier material act as a protective cover against the toxicity of pendimethalin. The enhanced pendimethalin degradation rate can also be ascribed to higher cell population density and higher activity of the cells immobilized in or on these carrier inert materials. Similarly, the inert materials served as a protective cover towards 2-nitrotoluene (Mulla et al. 2013) and 3-nitrobenzoate (Mulla et al. 2012). Likewise, the higher degradation rates of various toxic nitroaromatics were attributed to higher cell density in the matrices (Cassidy et al. 1996; Qi et al. 2012). Increased concentration of pendimethalin was better tolerated and degraded by PUF-immobilized cells than B. lehensis XJU cells immobilized in agar, SA, and polyacrylamide, as well as free cells. The cells of Micrococcus luteus Z3 immobilized in PUF had the higher nitrobenzene degradation capacity compared to free suspended cells (Qi et al. 2012). The moderate degradation rate observed with bacterial cells immobilized in agar, alginate, and polyacrylamide can be attributed to the leakage that may result from the mechanical instability and monomer and/or radical toxicity (Hall and Rao 1989; Trevors et al. 1992).

The semi-continuous degradation data showed that polyacrylamide and PUF-immobilized cells retained the pendimethalin degrading ability for a longer period since they could be reused for 26 and 35 cycles, respectively. But when the concentration of pendimethalin increased, polyurethane foam (PUF)-immobilized cells degraded pendimethalin faster than polyacrylamide-immobilized cells, which suggest that the PUF immobilization is a better technique for the degradation of toxic herbicides in the environment. However, the bacterial cells immobilized in SA and agar exhibited lower degradation ability of pendimethalin with increased cycle numbers. This was ascribed to the mechanical instability and gradual cell leakage from the inert porous beads (Trevors et al. 1992; Ha et al. 2009). Similarly, polyurethane foam was also an excellent support for the degradation of numerous nitroaromatics by bacterial cells (Zheng et al. 2009; Mulla et al. 2012, 2013). The increased degradation rate was ascribed to adsorbing capacity, stability, mechanical strength, and high porosity for the PUF-immobilized cells (Romaškevic et al. 2006).

The immobilized cells on PUF exhibited an excellent resistance to pH and temperature alterations, and had the better storage stability of more than 3 months than freely suspended cells in degrading pendimethalin. Similarly, the free and PUF-immobilized Micrococcus cells were active in the pH 7.0–8.0 at 30–35 °C and 5.0–10.0 at 25–40 °C, respectively, in degrading 2-nitrotoluene (Mulla et al. 2013). Likewise, a narrow range of pH (6.5–7.5) and temperature (30–35 °C), and a broad range of pH (5.0 to 10.0) and temperature (20–40 °C) were observed for freely suspended and PUF-immobilized cells, respectively, in degrading 3-nitrobenzoate (Mulla et al. 2012). The immobilized cells could be stored more than 3 months without losing too much pendimethalin degradation capacity. Similarly, the PUF-immobilized cells of Bacillus flexus strain XJU-4 and Micrococcus sp. strain SMN-1 were stored for 60 and 70 days at 4 °C without losing the capacity to degrade 3-nitrobenzoate (Mulla et al. 2012) and 2-nitrotoluene (Mulla et al. 2013), respectively. An effective biodegradation of elevated concentration of dinitroaniline herbicides (such as pendimethalin) and various nitroaromatic compounds can be achieved using immobilized microbial technology.

Conclusion
The present investigation has revealed the biodegradation of pendimethalin by the bacterial isolate B. lehensis XJU. It also showed the pendimethalin biodegradation by freely suspended and immobilized B. lehensis XJU on different matrices. The microorganisms capable of degrading toxic compounds can therefore be immobilized by entrapment in an inexpensive supports and the immobilized cells retain their ability over a considerable period of time, especially for PUF. Thus, the immobilized microbial cell systems may find applications in the treatment of various contaminated environment sites. However, prior to large-scale application of such systems, further studies are needed for determining the optimal operating conditions.

Introduction
l-Asparaginase enzymes (l-asparagine amidohydrolase) catalyse the hydrolysis of l-asparagine to l-aspartate and ammonia, and to a lesser extent, the hydrolysis of l-glutamine to l-glutamate (Ebrahiminezhad et al. 2011). Bacterial l-asparaginase are of two types: type 1 and type 2; type 2 showed antitumor activity because of which interest in l-asparaginase arose (Lee et al. 1989). Normal cells can synthesize l-asparaginase and because of their ability to produce this amino acid, normal cells are protected from l-asparaginase starvation unlike tumor cells which are dependent on an exogenous supply (Oza et al. 2011). Depletion of the circulating l-asparaginase by l-asparaginase enzyme results in anti-neoplastic activity. However, Escherichia coli and Erwinia sp. enzymes have been frequently used in cancer therapy (Avramis and Panosyan 2005).

l-Asparaginase from bacterial origin can cause hypersensitivity in the long term used, leading to allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. The toxicity is partially attributable to the glutaminase activity of these enzymes (Oza et al. 2011). l-Asparaginases with high asparaginase activity and negligible glutaminase activity are reported to be less troublesome during the course of antitumor therapy (Hawkins et al. 2004). The search for other asparaginase sources, with new immunological characteristics can lead to enzyme with less adverse effects. Furthermore, new studies have revealed potential application of this enzyme in prevention of acrylamide formation in fried potatoes and similar food products. Therefore, introduction of new fermentation and purification protocols for production of l-asparaginase II will be mandatory to satisfy these demands (Aghaeepoor et al. 2011). So, in this study we will be describing the cloning, expression, purification and characterization of recombinant l-asparaginase from P. fluorescens into E. coli BL21.

Materials and methods
Materials
l-Asparaginase-specific primers used in this study were synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich Co (India). Taq polymerase and dNTPs were procured from Bangalore Genei (India) Pvt. Ltd. and pET101 TOPO vector kit was obtained from Invitrogen (India). l-Asparagine and Lysozyme was obtained from Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai. Sonicator used was manufactured by Qsonica and Fermenter was designed and manufactured by CFTRI. E. coli BL21, E. coli DH5α and Pseudomonas fluorescens isolates were precured from CSIR-CFTRI, Mysore.

DNA isolation and synthesis
Pseudomonas fluorescens was inoculated into induced 50 ml broth and was grown overnight followed by centrifuging and washing thoroughly with sterile distilled water to remove all traces of broth and extraneous material. Extraction of DNA was carried out using Lysozyme solution. Sequences homologous to ASP were sought in the NCBI using BLAST. A DNA sequence of l-asparaginase from P. fluorescens (GI no: 255961261) was used for primer synthesis. PCR was used to amplify the full-length DNA. The DNA synthesis was carried out in a total volume of 25 µl, containing 1 µl of DNA templet, 1 µl each of both forward and reverse primer, 0.3 µl taq polymerase, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 2.5 µl PCR Buffer and 18.7 µl milli q water. The PCR procedure comprised 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 63.6 °C and 30 s at 72 °C. A final extension time at 72 °C for 10 min was performed after the 30 cycles. The resulting PCR amplicon was sequenced.

Cloning of ASP gene
For cloning, the primers were designed in such a manner that they included the CACC sites at 5′ end of the PCR amplicon, so it can be used for TOPO PET101 vector. The forward primer PFVJF3: 5′-CACCATGACATGTGCTTTGAAGAGTTTCGTCCGG-3′ and the reverse primer PFVJR4: 5′-TCAGTATTCCCAGAACATCCGTTGCAGCTC-3′ was used. The resulting amplified PCR amplicon was obtained through PCR with the conditions mentioned above. The amplified product was cloned with the plasmid vector pET101. The cloned vector was transformed to competent E. coli DH5α cells. The transformed E. coli cells were grown into LB agar plate containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin, IPTG and X-gal. The recombinant clones were identified by blue/white selection and grown at 37 °C in 50 ml LB medium containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin. The plasmid was isolated from E. coli DH5α and was used to transform competent E. coli BL21 cells which were screened with blue/white selection.

Pilot fermentation
The cells were grown into LB agar plate containing ampicillin. Scale up of recombinant clones was done for 6 L medium for fermentation in 10 L fermenter. The recombinant clones were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 µg/ml) at fermentation conditions of 37 °C with agitation of 180 rpm and aeration of 2 vvm. Synthesis of asparaginase was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG after 6–8 h of growth.

Purification of asparaginase
Purification of asparaginase was done 16 h after induction by IPTG, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000g for 3 h. Cells obtained after harvesting were resuspended into 15 mM phosphate buffer with pH 6.3, grounded manually with sterile sand and centrifuged at 10,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and used for purification. The fusion protein purification was done by treatment with 2 mg/ml lysozyme for 2 h and then sonication at 60 % amplitude for 5 min with 30 s burst. After sonication, the extract was centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. The extracted solution was then loaded to a pre-equilibrated Sepharose 6B column (1 × 20 cm) with mobile phase 15 mM phosphate buffer with pH 6.3 (Gladilina et al. 2009). The fractions collected (2 ml) were assayed for asparaginase activity. The purified enzyme was dialyzed to remove salt.

Estimation of ASNase activity
Asparaginase assay for native and modified ASNases was performed for the formation of β-aspartylhydroxamate (Ramakrishnan and Joseph 1996). Authentic β-aspartylhydroxamate was employed as a standard. One unit (U) of asparaginase is defined as the amount of enzyme that formed 1 µmol of β-aspartylhydroxamate in 1 min under assay conditions. The specific activity is expressed as U/mg/min of protein. Protein content was measured according to (Bradford 1976) using BSA as a standard.

Kinetic analysis
Determination of kinetic constants
Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed to obtain kinetic constants Km and Vmax, of the purified l-asparaginase were determined by the method of Lineweaver and Burk (1934) with different concentrations (0.5 mM–1 M) of l-asparagine as a substrate at room temperature using sodium phosphate buffer (15 mM, pH 6.3).

Effect of pH and temperature on enzyme activity
The effect of pH on purified enzyme was investigated in the pH range 5.0–9.0 (using 15 mM sodium acetate buffer for pH 5.0–6.0, sodium phosphate buffer for pH 7.0–8.0 and carbonate-bicarbonate buffer for pH 9.0). The enzyme was incubated in these buffers for 1 h and the assay was carried out as given above. The optimal temperature for l-asparaginase activity of the purified enzyme was measured by incubating the enzyme-substrate mixtures for 1 h at various temperatures (8–45 °C) at pH 6, and the liberated ammonia and β-aspartylhydroxamate were measured.

Effect of macro-nutrients on l-asparaginase activity
Macro-nutrients including sodium (NaCl), potassium (KCl), magnesium (MgCl2), iron (FeCl3) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) at 1 mM were evaluated for their effect on l-asparaginase activity by incubating the enzyme at optimum pH and temperature for 1 h, and then ASNase activity was assayed by estimating the product formed at 500 nm. Relative activities were calculated and compared with the native ASNase.

Thermal stability and half-life of cloned ASNase
To study the thermal stability of ASNase, the cloned enzyme was incubated at 28 °C (room temperature) and 37 °C in the absence of the substrate. At periodic intervals, aliquots were withdrawn and assay was performed as described above. The residual activity was expressed as percent of the initial activity. The inactivation rate constants (kd) were calculated from slopes of a semi-logarithmic plot of residual activity versus time, and apparent half lives were estimated using Eq. (1). The time where the residual activity reaches 50 % is known as the half-life (Kishore et al. 2014). 1 t1/2=ln2/kd 

Results
Cloning and expression of ASP gene
The DNA yield obtained through Lysozyme method from Pseudomonas fluorescens was of good quantity and suitable for further use. The DNA was used as a template for synthesizing and amplifying desired l-asparaginase DNA by PCR and the PCR amplicon was purified. To select the required expression product, pET101 vector was chosen. The amplified product was checked for the presence of gene of interest by using the desired primers by PCR. The fusion plasmid with gene was used to initially transform into E. coli DH5α. The plasmid from E. coli DH5α cells was purified and used to transform expression host E. coli BL21. Cell-free extract of the E. coli BL21 gave fusion protein-asparaginase complex with a total protein content of 2.16 mg protein/ml.

Purification of asparaginase
Fusion protein-asparaginase complex was given a lysozyme treatment and sonication, and was then purified in a one-step procedure (Table 1). In the purification scheme, a Sepharose 6B column was used. Pre-treated enzyme extract was applied directly to the Sepharose column equilibrated with 15 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.3. The enzyme was obtained as per size exclusion and was eluted. The asparaginase activity was shown by fractions with a specific activity of 11.6 IU/mg protein. The purity of the final asparaginase was evaluated by SDS-PAGE, which showed that the Asparaginase is a tetramer with molecular weight of the cloned product around 141 kDa (Fig. 1).Table 1 Purification of recombinant l-asparaginase from E. coli

Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed according to “Materials and methods”, Michaelis–Menten plot was done (Fig. 2) and kinetic constants Km was found to be 109.99 mM and Vmax was 2.88 µM/min.Fig. 2 Michaelis–Menten kinetics of l-asparaginase versus the concentration of l-asparagine



Effect of pH on enzyme activity
Since microorganisms are sensitive to the concentration of hydrogen ions present in the medium, pH is considered as an important factor that determines the growth, morphology and product formation. Effect of pH was studied in range of 5–9 according to “Materials and methods” and it was observed that the optimum pH was 6.3 (Fig. 3).Fig. 3 Effect of pH on l-asparaginase activity at room temperature



Effect of temperature on enzyme activity
After obtaining the optimum pH for enzyme, the experiments were run at phosphate buffer pH of 6.3 at different temperatures from 8 to 45 °C according to “Materials and methods” and it was observed that enzyme activities at 8 °C was low, and there was a gradual increase in activity with increase in temperature up to 34 °C which was found to be optimum temperature (Fig. 4). Further rise in temperature would have led to the degradation of enzyme and thermal deactivation; hence there is a decrease in enzyme activity.Fig. 4 Effect of temperature on l-asparaginase activity at pH 6.3



Effect of metal ions
Effect of few metal ions was studied according to “Materials and methods”. With the cloned enzyme, not much inhibitory effect was seen on the enzyme activity (Table 2). The activity of control cloned enzyme was similar to the enzyme in the presence of metal ions.Table 2 Inhibition of activities of enzyme with different Metal ions

Discussion
In the present study, we have produced l-asparaginase by cloning the asparaginase gene from Pseudomonas sp. into E. coli, for that we started our work with isolation of DNA, primer designing for asparaginase gene, cloning into pET101 for expression and pTZ57 R/T vector for sequencing, expression of the Asparaginase gene into E. coli BL21, obtaining large quantity of enzyme using 10 L fermenter, purifying the enzyme and finally characterizing the cloned purified Asparaginase was carried out. Recombinant l-asparaginase was developed by cloning l-asparaginase from Erwinia carotovora NCYC 1526 (Er A) and expressing in E. coli. The enzyme was purified by anion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on immobilized asparagine (Kotzia and Labrou 2005). Recombinant l-asparaginase has been produced by the use of molecular cloning and genetic engineering techniques. E. coli mutants resistant to substrate l-asparaginase were studied by Spring et al. (1986). It was found that the genes encoding l-asparaginase-I and l-asparaginase-II were not sequence related.

Cloning of E. coli gene ansB encoding l-asparaginase-II, using strategy based on PCR, and sequencing the gene was discussed by Bonthron (1990). The amino acid sequence differed from 11 positions from the data previously derived by direct amino acid sequencing. Expression of l-asparaginase-II encoded by ansB in Salmonella enterica was found to be positively regulated by a cAMP receptor protein (cRP) and anaerobiosis (Jennings and Beacham 1993). Abundance of AS mRNA was measured by RQ-PCR as reported by Irino et al. (2007), the AS mRNA level paralleled the AS enzyme activity and the AS protein level. Cellular levels of AS synchronized with cellular resistance to l-asparaginase in cell lines. Recombinant l-asparaginase from Erwinia carotovora, and purified by 1-step chromatography, was described by Krasotkina et al. (2004). The kinetic properties showed that recombinant l-asparaginase combined the main advantages of Erwinia chrysanthemi and E. colil-asparaginase-II. l-asparaginase from Erwinia chrysanthemi 3937 (Erl-ASNase) has been expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Kotzia and Labrou 2007). The enzyme was found to be a tetramer with molecular weight of approximately 141 kDa. It had a pH optima at 6.3 and temperature optima of 34 °C with Km of 109.99 mM and Vmax of 2.88 µM/min. Its activation energies were found to be dependent on the substrate. The l-asparaginase-II functional form exists as tetramer in Pseudomonas geniculate (Kitto et al. 1979) and E. coli (Khushoo et al. 2004) with molecular mass range from 140 to 160 kDa (Aghaiypour et al. 2001, El-Naggar et al. 2014). The l-asparaginase gene of E. coli alpha-acetyl actate decarboxylate gene (ALDC) of B. brevis were amplified by PCR and cloned into a new vector transformed into S. cerevisiae. Most of the enzyme activities were secreted into the medium and the new vectors had excellent segregation stability (Zhao et al. 2002). The enzymatic and structural properties of the recombinant enzyme were investigated and the kinetic parameters [Km, Kcat] for a number of substrates were determined. The enzyme was later immobilized on epoxy-activated Sepharose CL-6B as described by Gladilina et al. (2009) who have taken SP-Sepharose (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8. The immobilized enzyme retained most of its activity (60 %) and showed high stability at 4 °C. l-Asparaginase II gene isolated from thermotolerant E. coli strain, cloned in pET20b vector with 6His residues at a c-terminus downstream to the T7 promoter and pelB leader sequence, and biochemically characterized. Apart from clinical use, this enzyme can be used in fried starchy food preparation to reduce the acrylamide content, a potent carcinogen formed during the baking process by the reaction of asparaginase and sugar at hight temperature (Muharram et al. 2014). Application of microbial Lasparaginase in reducing acrylamide formation during the bread-making process, without affecting its physico-sensory properties and play an important role in reducing the formation of acrylamide. Reduction of toxic metabolites like acrylamide and HMF, i.e., Hydroxymethylfurfural (another toxic Maillard reaction compound) formed during baking, was also reduced by l-asparaginase treatment. The enzyme-treated bread was same as control bread with respect to organoleptic properties. This opens avenues for the application of microbial enzymes in obtaining safe foods (Mohan Kumar et al. 2014).

Cloning of E. coli gene ansB encoding l-asparaginase-II, using strategy based on PCR, and sequencing the gene was discussed by (Bonthron 1990). The amino acid sequence differed from 11 positions from the data previously derived by direct amino acid sequencing. Expression of l-asparaginase-II encoded by ansB in Salmonella enterica was found to be positively regulated by a cAMP receptor protein (cRP) and anaerobiosis (Jennings and Beacham 1993).

Conclusion
The cloned enzyme was studied for its stability at 28 °C (room temperature) and at 37 °C, and it was observed that the cloned Asparaginase was stable with a half-life of 35 h at 28 °C (room temperature) and 45.5 h at 37 °C. Cloned Asparaginase was better in terms of activity and stability at 37 °C. This enzyme could be used/stored for longer time periods at room temperature for experiments relating to acrylamide reduction in food products. Also, its higher half-life at 37 °C makes it a more suitable enzyme to be used against cancerous cells.

S. ostrea was more efficient than P. chrysosporium in decoloration process. Different parameters pH, temperature, sources of carbon and nitrogen, stationary and shaking conditions were optimized for bleaching of dye by the fungal cultures. Optimal growth conditions for decoloration of dye by both cultures were pH 5.0, temperature 35 °C, glucose and fructose as best carbon source at 1 % level, peptone and urea as best nitrogen source and shaking conditions (150 rpm). Culture broth free of colour (99 % of decoloration) was achieved with S. ostrea as against 70 % decoloration by P. chrysosporium on 6th day of incubation. Adsorption of dye to fungal biomass as reflected by colour coating on biomass and participation of lignolytic enzymes in colour removal appeared to be mechanisms involved in decoloration process. The ability of both fungal cultures in removal of colour in effluents with dyes collected from silk saree-weaving cottage unit was tested. S. ostrea was also found to be more effective in colour removal from effluent. S. ostrea appears to be a promising culture for application of bioremediation in decoloration of dyes.

Introduction
Synthetic dyes are a group of organic aromatic molecular structural compounds that are extensively used in textile, paper, printing and dye houses (Lilly and Barnett 1951; Jacob and Azariah 2000; Aksu 2005) . According to their dissociation in an aqueous solution, dyes can be classified as acid, direct reactive dyes (anionic), basic dyes (cationic) and disperse dyes (nonionic) (Mishra and Tripathi 1983). Many chemical dyes are being used increasingly in textile and dyeing industries because of their ease and cost effectiveness in synthesis, firmness and variety in colour compared to that of natural dyes (Mathur et al. 2005). India’s dye industry produces every type of dyes and pigments. Production of dyestuff and pigments in India is close to 80,000 tonnes per annum (Mathur et al. 2005). India is the second largest exporter of dyestuffs and intermediates after China (Mathur et al. 2005).

The textile industry accounts for the largest consumption of dyestuffs, at nearly 80 % (Mathur et al. 2005). According to the survey of the Ecological and Toxicological Association of the Dyestuffs Manufacturing Industry (ETAD), over 90 % of some 4000 dyes have LD50 values greater than 2000 mg/kg (Robinson et al. 2001) which is very dangerous to nature. Effluents from the textile industries containing dyes are highly coloured and are, therefore, visually identifiable (Kilic et al. 2007). The coloured effluents damage the aesthetic quality of water and soil and reduce light penetration and photosynthesis and also some of the dyes are toxic or mutagenic, carcinogenic and allergenic (Kumar et al. 2006). Because of the widespread use and potential carcinogenicity of certain dyes, there has been a growing interest in assessing the hazards associated with dyes available in local markets and hence decoloration of the dye-bearing effluents is of great importance. Everything touched by king Midas turned to gold. By a sort of inversion process, everything that modern men touch turns to a waste product sooner or later. Wastes are usually discarded into water, with or without processing. At present, water is becoming a rare commodity, and the available water resources are inadequate to meet the essential needs of man. Improper disposal methods and inadequate control of toxic effluents from different industries have led to the widespread contamination of surface as well as groundwater and have made the water resources unfit for usage (Odum et al. 1969).

The traditional physical or chemical decoloration methods including coagulation, flocculation, ion exchange, irradiation, precipitation, ozonation and adsorption or a combination of these methods have been used for dye removal from wastewaters (Akar et al. 2009). However, application of these methods is somewhat restricted due to some limitations such as operational costs, formation of hazardous by-products, intensive energy requirement (Padmesh et al. 2005) and limited adaptability to a wide range of effluents (Fu and Viraraghavan 2001). Dye removal from waste water by established waste water treatment processes are expensive and need careful application (Vandevivere et al. 1998). Furthermore, following anaerobic digestion, nitrogen-containing dyes are transformed into aromatic amines that are more toxic and mutagenic than the parent molecules (Ganesh et al. 1999). To overcome these difficulties, microorganisms are being investigated for their potential to bleach dye-bearing effluents. Biotechnological approaches were proven to be potentially effective in treatment of this pollution source in an eco-efficient manner (Robinson et al. 2001). Although many microorganisms belonging to different taxonomic groups of bacteria (Wu et al. 2005) and algae (Dilek et al. 1999) have been reported for their ability to bleach different dyes, fungi, in particular, white-rot group are recognized for their superior capacity to produce extracellular lignolytic enzymes such as laccase (Lac), lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) (Gao et al. 2010; Praveen et al. 2011) which are highly oxidative and nonspecific in action and responsible for degradation and decoloration of a wide range of dyes (Aksu 2005; Praveen et al. 2011). The capacity of organisms in bio-bleaching process of dye differs from one organism to another and is dependent on inherent capacity of the organism, growth conditions and structure of dye. This is quite evident from a comparative study (Baldrian and Snajdr 2006) that five litter-decomposing fungi (LDF) and two reference white-rot cultures exhibited difference in rates of bio-bleaching of 4 dyes including RBB-19 in high nitrogen and high carbon (HNHC) medium. According to this study, the reference culture Trametes versicolor  and LDF Collybia dryophilia displayed the fastest degradation of the dye Poly B-411 whereas other cultures LDF X1 and X2 caused most rapid decoloration of RBB-19. Similarly, Stropharia rugosoannulata was found to decolorise efficiently anthraquinone dye Basic Blue 22 (Jarosz-Wilkolazka et al. 2002). In this study, we report the ability of S. ostrea to bleach the dye—RBB-19 in medium and effluents from silk saree-weaving cottage unit in comparison to the reference culture P. chrysosporium whose potential in color removal of dyes was assessed earlier (Rojek et al. 2004).

Materials and methods
Fungal cultures
The fungal cultures—S. ostrea and P. chrysosporium—were maintained on Koroljova-skorobogat’ko medium (1998) containing the following composition (g/l): 3.0 peptone, 5.0 glucose, 0.6 KH2PO4, 0.5 MgSO4, 0.4 K2HPO4, 0.05 MnSO4, 0.001ZnSO4, 0.0005 FeSO4, 20.0 agar (pH 6.0).

Dye characterization
RBB-19 is one of the dyes used for colouring textile fibers and was provided by a dyeing unit, Dharmavaram, Anantapuramu district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Chemical structure of the selected dye is specified in Fig. 1. Spectrophotometric scanning of dye solution was performed in a UV–Visible spectrophotometer (Chemito-UV-2600) and the absorption maximum of RBB-19 was identified as 590 nm.Fig. 1 Chemical structure of RBB-19



Growth conditions for bleaching
All experiments with both fungal cultures were conducted in Koroljova liquid medium in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Fungal mycelial suspension was prepared by adding 2 ml of sterile distilled water to the freshly grown 7-day slants of the above cultures. The homogenized mycelial suspension of cultures was used to inoculate 50 ml of liquid media amended with RBB-19 at 0.02 % concentration (unless specified) into 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks and all flasks were incubated for growth at 30 °C and speed of 200 rpm in an incubator cum shaker (ORBITEK, India).

Triplicate flasks were withdrawn daily and harvested by passing through Whatman filter paper No.1 for collection of supernatant and fungal biomass. Supernatant/culture filtrate, free of fungal biomass, was spun at 10,000g for 15 min in a cooling centrifuge (REMI C24-BL) and used for estimation of bleaching. Dry weight of fungal biomass on filter paper after drying in an oven at 70 °C was quantified.

Optimization for bleaching of dye
For optimization of bleaching of dye RBB-19, only one of the factors of physical parameters and nutrient parameters in growing medium was varied at a time by keeping all other factors constant. Both cultures were grown in presence of dye RBB-19 at 0.02 % concentration and bleaching experiments were repeated in the same manner as mentioned above. For determination of optimal pH, Koroljova medium after amendment of dye was adjusted to initial desired pH within a range of 3.0–7.0. Cultures were grown on medium set to desired pH and bleaching of dye was estimated in the same way as done earlier. For proceeding to optimize the next factor, Koroljova medium with dye was set to optimal value of pH 6.0 and incubated at different temperatures (20–50 °C) after inoculation of fungal cultures in an orbital shaker at speed of 200 rpm. The extent of bleaching that took place was estimated in the same manner as described previously. For selection of the best carbon source, sucrose, fructose, maltose or starch at 1 % concentration was included in Koroljova medium amended with dye RBB-19 at 0.02 %. Cultures were grown in the same manner as described earlier. The percentage of decoloration of dye was recorded. Experiment was repeated in the same way as carbon source for selection of the best nitrogen source. For this purpose peptone of Koroljova medium was replaced with different nitrogen sources yeast extract, ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate or urea at 1 % level.

Effect of stationary and shaking conditions
To determine the effect of stationary and shaking conditions on decoloration of RBB-19 by the fungal cultures, one set of flasks with medium containing dye was incubated at 30 °C under stationary conditions. Four sets of flasks with medium with cultures were incubated in a rotary shaker at speed of 50, 100, 150 and 200 rpm at 30 °C for 6 days. Flasks were processed on 6th day of incubation for assessment of decoloration in the same manner as described earlier.

Effect of initial dyestuff concentrations
To test the capacity of both cultures to bleach the highest concentration of RBB-19, dye was included in optimized medium at varying concentrations within a range 0.04–0.2 %. Cultures were grown in the medium under optimal conditions and processed for assessment of bleaching in the same manner as done for previous experiments.

Assay of lignolytic enzymes
Activities of lignolytic enzymes in the cultural filtrate of both fungal cultures derived from growth on Koroljova medium with dye were estimated following the standard protocols. Laccase activity was assayed using 10 mM guaiacol in 100 mM acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 10 % (V/V) acetone. The change in absorbance of the reaction mixture containing guaiacol was monitored at 470 nm (ε = 6740 M−1 cm−1) for 5 min of incubation (Das et al. 1997). Laccase activity was expressed in International Units (IU) where one unit corresponded to the amount of enzyme that oxidized one micromole of guaiacol per minute. Lignin peroxidase activity was determined by oxidation of veratryl alcohol at 310 nm (ε = 9300 M−1 cm−1) (Tien and Kirk  1988). The reaction mixture was composed of 0.5 ml culture filtrate, 0.4 mM H2O2 and 50 mM tartaric acid (pH 2.5) and 2 mM veratryl alcohol. The enzyme activity was expressed in IU where one unit of LiP corresponded to the amount of enzyme that oxidized one micromole of veratryl alcohol per min. MnP activity was determined by oxidation of phenol red at 610 nm (Kuwahara et al. 1984). The assay mixture included 0.5 ml culture filtrate, 0.25 M sodium lactate (pH 4.5), 0.5 % bovine albumin, 200 mM MnSO4, 2.0 mM H2O2 (prepared in 0.2 mM sodium succinate buffer pH 4.5) and 0.1 % phenol red. The change in absorbance of reaction mixture was monitored at 610 nm (ε = 22,000 M−1 cm−1) for 5 min. MnP activity was expressed in IU where one unit of MnP was defined as the amount of enzyme that oxidized one micromole of phenol red per min.

Bleaching of effluent
Effluent was collected from a local dyeing unit of silk sarees, Dharmavaram, Andhra Pradesh, India. The effluent was checked for pH which was found to be 11.0. Scanning of the effluent in a UV–Visible spectrophotometer (Chemito-UV-2600) indicated the presence of dye RBB-19 in effluent. After adjustment of pH 5.0, effluent was amended with glucose at 1 and 2 % concentration and was grown with fungal cultures under optimal conditions in 250-ml Erlenmeyer conical flasks in the same manner as specified above. The flasks were processed for assessment of bleaching of dye on 6th day of incubation.

Decoloration assay
At the end of each experiment the supernatants were subjected to dye decoloration analysis. Medium without dye and inoculum and dye-amended medium without inoculum were maintained as controls. Absorbance of colour of dye in the uninoculated medium amended with dye was measured against uninoculated medium without dye at 590 nm at any given time interval and is treated as absorbance of control. Absorbance of colour of dye in the culture filtrate derived from the growth of fungi was measured against uninoculated medium without dye at 590 nm at the respective time interval and was considered as observed absorbance. Decoloration was expressed as activity (%). Decolorization \%=Control absorbance-Observed absorbanceControl absorbance×100 

Results
Knowledge of nutrient requirements and conditions for growth of unexplored organisms is essential for their effective utilization in bio-bleaching of dyes. Hence, experiments were conducted with S. ostrea to widen our knowledge base.

Decolorization of RBB-19 by fungal cultures
Growth of the fungal cultures in defined Koroljova medium in the presence of dye, RBB-19 at 0.02 % for 10 days resulted in bleaching of dye (Fig. 2). Dye decoloration was observed from the first day onwards in both cultures. Maximum decoloration of dye by S. ostrea cultures was found to be 93 % on 6th day of incubation whereas P. chrysosporium could achieve only 65.5 %. Further incubation of the cultures did not improve colour removal.Fig. 2 Decoloration of RBB-19 by fungal cultures



Effect of initial pH and temperature on decoloration
Decoloration of RBB-19 in cultures of S. ostrea and P. chrysosporium grown on Koroljova medium at different pH levels (3.0–8.0) is presented in Fig. 3. Initial pH of medium for growth of the cultures had influence on decoloration of dye. The decoloration of dye by these cultures was found to be optimal at pH 5.0. S. ostrea caused 94.5 % decoloration of dye as against 63.9 % by P. chrysosporium at pH 5.0 on 6th day of incubation. There was a drop in bleaching of dye by the fungal cultures on either side of the optimal pH.Fig. 3 Effect of pH on decoloration of RBB-19 by fungal cultures on 6th day of incubation



The influence of various temperatures (20–60 °C) on decoloration of RBB-19 is shown in Fig. 4. Maximum decolorization of 95.7 and 65 % occurred in cultures of S. ostrea and P. chrysosporium grown at 35 °C, respectively. The decreasing trend of decoloration was noticed in cultures grown at higher temperatures (50–60 °C).Fig. 4 Effect of temperature on decoloration of RBB-19 by fungal cultures on 6th day of incubation



Effect of concentration of carbon sources (1 %) on decoloration
Different carbon sources were added into medium to study their effect on decoloration efficiency by fungal cultures (Fig. 5). Maximum colour removal of 98.5 and 68 % by S. ostrea and P. chrysosporium was achieved with glucose and fructose followed by sucrose on 6th day of incubation, respectively.Fig. 5 Effect of carbon sources on decoloration of RBB-19 by fungal cultures on 6th day of incubation



Effect of nitrogen sources on decoloration
Bleaching of dye in cultures grown on medium with various nitrogen sources on 6th day of incubation was assessed by S. ostrea and P. chrysosporium (Fig. 6). Maximum decoloration of dye to the tune of 99 and 70 % was achieved on medium with urea followed by peptone on 6th day of incubation. However, the percent of decoloration on medium containing other nitrogen sources was lower.Fig. 6 Effect of nitrogen sources on decoloration of RBB-19 by fungal cultures on 6th day of incubation



Effect of stationary and shaking conditions
Decoloration of RBB-19 in the fungal cultures grown under stationary and shaking conditions with different speed on 6th day of incubation was examined (Table 1). Both fungal cultures exhibited maximum percent of decoloration under shaking conditions as compared under stationary conditions. S. ostrea and P. chrysosporium could bring out 99 and 80 % of decoloration under shaking conditions at 150 rpm as against 90.8 and 58 % under stationary conditions, respectively (Table 1). Although agitation/shaking at 150 rpm was more beneficial to P. chrysosporium in bleaching dye, S. ostrea performed better than P. chrysosporium on bleaching of dye.Table 1 Effect of stationary and shaking on decoloration of RBB-19 by fungal cultures on 6th day of incubation

Fungus	% Decolorization of dye in the culture filtrate	
Stationary conditions	Shaking conditions	
50 rpm	100 rpm	150 rpm	200 rpm	

S. ostrea
	90.8	94.5	97.9	99	99	

P. chrysosporium
	58	62.5	75.8	80	80	


Effect of dye concentration on decoloration
The concentration of dye, RBB-19, in the medium had influence on decoloration of dye by both fungal cultures (Fig. 7). The rate of decoloration was highest at the lowest concentration of dye (0.04 %) used in the medium as reflected by high percentage of decoloration by S. ostrea (96.7) and P. chrysosporium (71.5). The percent of decoloration gradually decreased as the concentration of dye in the medium was increased from 0.04 to 0.20 %.Fig. 7 Effect of dye concentration on decoloration of RBB-19 by fungal cultures on 6th day of incubation



Lignolytic enzymes of the fungal cultures
Growth of both cultures on optimized medium in the presence of dye, RBB-19, at 0.02 % concentration under optimal conditions exhibited three extracellular lignolytic enzymes Lac, LiP and MnP. Yields of Lac to the tune of 51 U/ml by S. ostrea on 6th day of incubation was recorded as against only 8.5 U/ml by P. chrysosporium. Titers of LiP and MnP in respect of S. ostrea were 1.9 and 3.1 U/ml, respectively, whereas the corresponding figures of enzymes in respect of P. chrysosporium were 0.52 and 1.07 U/ml.

Effluent treatment
Effluent carrying RBB-19 was amended with glucose and was set to pH 5.0. The performance of both fungal cultures on decoloration of effluent was tested. The fungal cultures S. ostrea and P. chrysosporium could bleach dye to the tune of 70 and 43 % in effluent amended with 1 % glucose on 6th day of incubation, respectively. Increase of glucose to 2 % in effluents was not beneficial to decoloration. The percentage of decoloration of dye in respect of S. ostrea and P. chrysosporium recorded on 6th day of incubation was 65 and 40 %, respectively.

Discussion
The performance of white-rot basidiomycetes S. ostrea and P. chrysosporium on decoloration of dye, RBB-19, at 0.02 % concentration in defined medium Koroljova medium under controlled conditions in shake flask for 10 days was examined in this study. S. ostrea was more efficient in colour removal than P. chrysosporium under growth conditions employed in this study.

Though S. ostrea exhibited bleaching of dye to a greater extent, maximum decoloration occurred in both cultures grown on medium set to pH 5 in the present study. At high pH the growth of both cultures was poor and even decoloration of dye was slow. Growth (data not shown) and decoloration proceeded in parallel at different pH. This is consistent with result of different white-rot fungi in a majority of studies (Kapdan et al. 2000; Asghar et al. 2006; Pallavi et al. 2011) that maximum growth of organisms and decoloration took place in acidic pH range. Decoloration of RBB-19 by both fungal cultures in the present study at different temperatures showed 35 °C as an optimum temperature. This is consistent with temperature optima of 30–37 °C for decoloration mediated by mesophilic white-rot fungi (Renganathan et al. 2006; Pallavi et al. 2011).

Both cultures, S. ostrea and P. chrysosporium, exhibited the same optimal conditions for decoloration of the dye, RBB-19 in the present study. The optimal conditions for bio-bleaching of the dye by the same cultures were pH 5.0, temperature 35 °C, and glucose and fructose as the best carbon and peptone and urea as the best nitrogen source. The best decoloration efficiencies (65–80 %) of the dye were obtained when Trametes versicolor grown in nitrogen-limited conditions under aerobic conditions in a fed-batch study (Moreira et al. 2004). Trametes pubescens completely removed colour of two anthraquinone dyes RBB-19 and B-49 in low-nitrogen minimal medium (LNMM) in bioreactor for 5 cycles with increasing concentration up to 1000 ppm.

Shaking was beneficial to decoloration of dye by the fungal cultures in particular to P. chrysosporium in the present study. Similar observations on decoloration of different dyes by a number of organisms, P. chrysosporium, Trametes spp, were made (Glenn et al. 1983; Kumar et al. 1998).

The rate of decoloration of dye by both fungal cultures in the present study decreased with increase in the concentration of dye from 0.04 to 0.2 % in the medium. Growth of the both fungal cultures at high concentration used in the study was severely affected. An observation of inverse relationship between concentration of dye in the medium and decoloration is in agreement with results of other study (Jarosz-Wilkolazka et al. 2002) that higher concentration (600–1000 mg/L) of reactive blue in the medium adversely affected both adsorption to mycelia and decoloration by Aspergillus ochraceus NCIM-1146. Fall in decolorizing activity of the fungal cultures at higher concentration of dye could be due to exhaustion of limited binding sites on biomass for adsorption even at lower concentration of dye.

Bleaching of color that appeared on mycelial mat of the cultures in the present study is probably due to involvement of lignolytic enzymes. Growth of S. ostrea in the presence of RBB-19 produced higher biomass (data not shown) and higher yields of lignolytic enzymes Lac, LiP and MnP than that of P. chrysosporium under conditions employed in the present study. In view of participation of lignolytic enzymes in decoloration, the presence of lignolytic enzymes in fungal cultures is routinely tested on decoloration assay with Poly 478 dye (Pointing 1999). Bleaching of RBB dye at high rate by S. ostrea in the present study could be attributed to its higher growth and its larger capacity to secrete lignolytic enzymes in higher titres. Evaluation of performance of the two cultures in shake flasks in removal of color from coloured waste water collected from a local cottage dying unit indicated that S. ostrea was more effective than P. chrysosporium.

Addition of 1 % glucose to waste water enhanced decoloration process whereas, increase in concentration of glucose results in decrease in decoloration. A similar observation was made that P. chrysosporium and Coriolus versicolor required only additional labile carbon–glucose in decoloration of anaerobically digested molasses spent wash (Kumar et al. 1998).

In summary, the isolate S. ostrea is better than the reference culture P. chrysosporium for decolorization of reactive textile dye. Even though both cultures displayed the same and identical optimal conditions, S. ostrea secreted lignolytic enzymes in larger amounts. S. ostrea performed better than P. chrysosporium in removal of color from effluent.

Curcumin shows poor solubility and low absorption, and therefore, its use as nanoparticles is beneficial due to their greater solubility and absorption. The main aim of the present study was the formation of curcumin nanoparticles (Nano curcu), evaluation of their antibacterial activity against human pathogenic bacteria and formulation of Nano curcu-based cream. We synthesized Nano curcu by sonication method. The synthesis of Nano curcu was assessed for their solubility in water and by UV–visible spectrophotometry. Further, the nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking and analysis, and zeta potential analysis. In vitro antibacterial activity of Nano curcu was evaluated against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cream containing Nano curcu was found to be effective against human bacterial pathogens and hence can be used for treatment of bacterial diseases.

Introduction
Curcuma longa L. is a perennial herb, which belongs to family Zingiberaceae, and commonly known as turmeric. It occurs in tropical and sub-tropical regions throughout the world. It is commonly cultivated in Asian countries, mostly in India and China and is extensively used in ayurveda, unani, and siddha systems of medicine as one of the household therapies to alleviate different diseases (Araujo and Leon 2000; Chattopadhyay et al. 2004; Nawaz et al. 2011). Curcumin suppresses the activity of many bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella paratyphi (Chaudhary and Sekhhon 2012) and Bacillus subtilis, B. macerans, B. licheniformis, and Azotobacter (Naz et al. 2010). Curcumin is also found to be effective against 20 types of Candida species (Martins et al. 2009). It has been observed by trials on human and mouse that oral consumption of curcumin shows less bioavailability and it undergoes intestinal metabolism (Sharma et al. 2005; Anand et al. 2007). These obstacles of curcumin can be eliminated by synthesis of curcumin nanoparticles (Nano curcu), liposomes, micelles, and phospholipid complexes which can be used for the purpose of longer circulation, permeability and increased resistance to metabolic processes (Aggarwal et al. 2006; Nawaz et al. 2011; Ravichandran 2013). Curcumin loaded in poly (lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) nanospheres was synthesized by using solid/oil/water emulsion solvent evaporation technique (Mukerjee and Vishwantha 2009). PLGA-loaded Nano curcu are one of the efficient tools which can be used in the cancer therapy (Mukerjee and Vishwantha 2009). Curcumin-loaded hydrogel nanoparticles can act as an adjuvant in malarial treatment which reduces the use of antimalarial drugs (Dandekar et al. 2010).

Polymeric synthesis of curcumin-loaded nanoparticles was found effective against malignant brain tumors by inhibiting the growth of brain tumor cells (Lim et al. 2011). In vitro study of synthesized nanoparticles by fatty acid coacervation technique revealed that they are effective in the treatment of cancer (Chirio et al. 2011). Also, curcumin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles were found to be novel candidates in the treatment of ovarian cancer (Yallapu et al. 2010). It was demonstrated from the study tha Nano curcu can stop the primary stage of metastasis, and therefore, it can be used as one of the novel treatments in cancer (Bisht et al. 2007). It was reported that the synthesis of solid lipid Nano curcu was useful to enhance the oral bioavailability of curcumin (Bansal and Munjal 2011). Antibacterial activity of Nano curcu was tested against different types of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bhavana et al. 2011). Silver nanocomposite film of curcumin was very effective material for antibacterial application (Varaprasad et al. 2011). The researchers have also prepared sodium carboxylmethyl cellulose (SCMC) silver nanocomposite films (Varaprasad et al. 2011). Curcumin chitosan-poly (vinyl alcohol)-silver nanocomposite film was prepared by Vimla et al. (2011) in order to increase applications as antibacterial packaging, wound dressing, and antibacterial materials. Different nanoparticles like curcumin, silver, and chitosan nanoparticles were synthesized and it was found that Nano curcu along with silver and chitosan nanoparticles showed anti-parasitic activity against Giardia lamblia (Said et al. 2012). Curcumin albumin nanoparticles were formulated by using desolvation method which is one of the novel methods of nanoparticles synthesis and albumin nanoparticles are one of the promising tools for increasing the action of curcumin as a drug (Jithan et al. 2011).

In the present study, we report physico-chemical synthesis of Nano curcu, their formulation and activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The formulated cream is a new generation of antiseptic cream which could be used against dermatological infections.

Materials and methods
Curcumin [1,7-bis (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione] powder was procured from Hi-Media Laboratories Ltd., Mumbai.

Synthesis of Nano curcu
Stock of curcumin solution (5 mg/ml) was prepared by dissolving curcumin powder in Dichloromethane (20 ml). One ml of stock solution was added to boiling water (50 ml) in drop-wise manner under ultrasonication condition with an ultrasonic power and frequency of 50 kHz. The solution was sonicated for about 30 min. After sonication, the mixture was stirred at 800 rpm for about 20 min till the orange colored precipitate was obtained. Thereafter, supernatant was discarded and the pellet obtained was used for further study.

Preliminary detection of Nano curcu by UV–visible spectroscopy
The preliminary detection of synthesized Nano curcu was carried out by UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1700, Japan), scanning the absorbance spectra in the range of 200–800 nm wavelength.

Characterization of Nano curcu
Nanoparticle tracking analysis system (NTA)
To determine average size and size distribution of Nano curcu, NTA analysis was performed by LM 20 (Nanosight Pvt. Ltd., UK). Liquid sample of Nano curcu was introduced into a scattering cell through which a laser beam (approx. 40 mW at k = 635 nm) was passed. Particles present within the path of the laser beam were observed via a dedicated non-microscope optical instrument LM 20 having CCD camera. The motion of the particles in the field of view (approx. 100 × 100 μm) was recorded (at 30 fps), and from the subsequent video and images, size of particles was calculated.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
Nano curcu were characterized by FTIR (Perkin-Elmer FTIR-1600, USA) mixing dried powder of nanoparticles with KBr. Spectra were taken in the range of 500–2000 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The data of FTIR reveal information about functional groups which are present in the Nano curcu.

Zeta potential measurement
Zeta potential measurements of synthesized nanoparticles were performed with Zetasizer Nano ZS 90 (Malvern Instrument ltd, UK) by using zeta dip cells. Zeta potential of synthesized nanoparticles was analyzed to determine the charges present on the surface of nanoparticles and its stability at pH 7. The samples for analysis were prepared by mixing of Nano curcu colloid in dichloromethane in 1:10 proportion. For measuring zeta potential, 1000 µl of the sample was taken in clear disposable zeta cells.

Transmission electron microscopy
Transmission electron microscopic analysis (TEM) was useful to determine the size and topology of synthesized Nano curcu. A drop of solution containing Nano curcu was placed on the carbon-coated copper grids and kept in infrared light until sample gets dried. After drying, powder of nanoparticles was loaded on specimen holder. TEM micrographs were taken by analyzing the prepared grids on Philips CM 200 super twin’s TEM operating at 200 kV (0.23 nm resolution) instrument.

X-ray diffraction method
X-ray diffraction is the method to determine crystalline structure or phase of crystal. Dried Nano curcu powder was used for analysis purpose. The diffraction patterns were recorded by PAN analytical X PRT PRO, D-8, Advanced Brucker instrument (The Netherlands).

In vitro evaluation of antibacterial activity of Nano curcu
Test bacteria
Escherichia coli (ATCC 14948) and S. aureus (ATCC 333591) were procured from American Type Culture Collection Center, USA, and P. aeruginosa (MTCC 4676) from Microbial Type Culture Collection, Chandigarh. The antibacterial activity of the Nano curcu and silver nanoparticles was assessed against test bacteria by using Kierby–Bauer disc diffusion method (Bauer et al. 1960). Antibiotics chloramphenicol and gentamycin were used as standard, while performing antibacterial activity of nanoparticles. These plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Zones of inhibition were measured.

Formulation of antibacterial cream
It was performed in two phases, that is, in water and oil phase. In water phase, 40 ml of distilled water was taken in beaker. Then, cetostearyl alcohol (8 g) was added and it was heated slightly to dissolve completely. It was followed by addition of methyl paraben (0.3 g) and dissolved by heating. Then, 30 g of glycerol was added followed by tween 80 (3.6 g). All the above components were mixed together (except drug) which results in the formation of water phase.

For oil phase, liquid paraffin (5 g) was taken in a separate beaker and it was heated. Then, white paraffin (10 g) was taken in another beaker and heated later, and liquid paraffin was mixed with it which results in the formation of oil phase. After the formation of both the phases, they were mixed together drop by drop with continuous stirring. After mixing of both the phases, Nano curcu (5 mg ml−1) were added to the mixture by continuous stirring on magnetic stirrer to dissolve the drug properly.

Results
Nano curcu detection was done by UV–visible spectroscopy and it was scanned in the range of 200–800 nm. The absorption spectra of curcumin in dichloromethane (control) and synthesized Nano curcu showed absorbance peak at 419 nm which is the characteristic feature of Nano curcu (Fig. 1). Further characterization of Nano curcu was performed by nanoparticles tracking and analysis system (NTA) to determine the average size and particle size distribution. From the NTA analysis, the mode value was found to be 92 nm, with the average size of 110 nm (Fig. 2). FTIR spectrum of curcumin in dichloromethane (control) and Nano curcu (experimental) was recorded. In FTIR spectrum of Nano curcu, peaks were observed at 1626, 1454, 1146 and 1037 cm−1 (Fig. 3). The zeta potential of Nano curcu was found to be −18 mV which showed moderate stability of Nano curcu (Fig. 4). The magnitude of the zeta potential gives an indication of the potential stability of the colloidal system. It is the potential which is measured, when one measures the velocity of the particles in a D.C. electric field. TEM analysis was performed to determine the size and shape of nanoparticles. It was found that Nano curcu showed spherical shape and polydisperse particles having the size range of 60–80 nm (Fig. 5). X-ray diffraction analyses are applied to determine the crystalline nature of Nano curcu. X-ray diffractograms of synthesized Nano curcu showed characteristic peaks at diffraction angle of 2θ at 23.03, 24.60, and 25.55 (Fig. 6).Fig. 1 UV–vis spectra of synthesized Nano curcu.

The antimicrobial activity of Nano curcu was tested against E. coli (ATCC 14948), S. aureus (ATCC 333591), and P. aeruginosa (MTCC 4676) (Fig. 7) by using Kierby–Bauer disc diffusion method. In the present study, Nano curcu, silver nanoparticles, combination of silver and Nano curcu, and antibiotics chloramphenicol and gentamycin were used to determine antibacterial activity. Nano curcu were found more effective (12 mm) against P. aeruginosa, whereas less effective (10 mm) against S. aureus. Silver nanoparticles were most effective against P. aeruginosa and less effective against S. aureus. Commercially available antibiotic chloramphenicol was found to be more effective against S. aureus (40 mm) and less effective against E. coli (29 mm). P. aeruginosa was susceptible to antibiotic gentamycin, whereas S. aureus was less susceptible to gentamycin (Fig. 7). Formulated cream (Fig. 8) of Nano curcu was found to be much more effective against P. aeruginosa (30 mm) and less effective against S. aureus (20 mm) (Fig. 9).Fig. 7 Antibacterial activity of Nano curcu against E.coli, S.aureus, P.aeruginosa.

Discussion
To confirm the synthesis of Nano curcu, solubility testing was performed in which Nano curcu were soluble in water, while curcumin powder was not soluble in water (Fig. 1 inset). It confirms the synthesis of Nano curcu. The results of UV–visible spectroscopy obtained in our study, corroborate with the result of Alam et al. (2012) and Ghosh et al. (2011) which specifies the synthesis of Nano curcu. The findings of NTA are similar with results obtained by Montes et al. (2010) for determining the size of polystyrene nanoparticles. In FTIR analysis, peaks correspond to different functional groups. Among these, the absorption peak at 1626 cm−1 can be assigned for C=C stretching, 1452 cm−1 corresponds to C=H, and the absorption at 1146 cm−1 due to C–H stretching. The absorption peak at 1037 cm−1 might be due to C–N stretch. The absorption spectra of control might be attributed to the functional group such as benzene ring, C–O–C bond, and aromatic C–H stretching. These finding are supported by many researchers (Yadav et al. 2009; Yen et al. 2010; Sav et al. 2012). Zeta potential measurement is used to characterize the surface charge of Nano curcu. The nanoparticles in colloidal suspension or emulsion carry electric charge which may be positive or negative. The synthesized Nano curcu were moderately stable. The X-Ray diffraction pattern confirms the crystals of Nano curcu which correspond with the results obtained by Sav et al. (2012) and Yen et al. (2010). Antibacterial activity of Nano curcu and silver nanoparticles alone was found to be more or less similar. But when Nano curcu and silver nanoparticles both were used in combination, it showed less zone of inhibition as compared with silver and Nano curcu when it is tested singly against different bacteria. Gentamycin showed higher activity against Gram-negative bacteria, whereas chloramphenicol showed better action against Gram-positive bacteria. From in vitro antibacterial assay of Nano curcu, it was found that Nano curcu showed better antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria as compared to Gram-positive ones, whereas bulk curcumin is more effective against Gram-positive bacteria. The variation in activities among bacteria may reflect differences in cell wall structures and composition between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

Proposed mechanism of antimicrobial activity of Nano curcu
The phenolic group in Nano curcu interacts with outer lipopolysaccharide layer present in the Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, less peptidoglycan content helps in the weakening and breakage of bacterial cell wall, resulting in the death of the bacterial cell. In addition, antibacterial cream of Nano curcu possesses both the water phase and oil phase. Both the phases are stabilized by surfactant. The oil phase of the cream helps in the better interaction of Nano curcu with the outer lipopolysaccharide layer present in the Gram-negative bacteria, thereby causing the disruption of the less rigid cell wall of the Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 10).Fig. 10 Proposed mechanism for antimicrobial activity of Nano curcu



Conclusions
Nano curcu were fabricated by physico-chemical method. It is simple, natural, and easy method used for the synthesis of Nano curcu. Synthesized nanoparticles showed its efficacy against bacteria, viz., E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa. It can be concluded from the results that Nano curcu synthesized by sonication method inhibited activity of bacteria. The formulated cream is new generation of antiseptic cream, which could be used in the treatment of infection caused by E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa. The Nano curcu could also be used for wound healing.

Different DNA-based marker systems have been utilized to assess the extent of genetic diversity in coconut. Advances in genomics research have resulted in the development of novel gene-targeted markers. In the present study, we have used a simple and novel marker system, start codon targeted polymorphism (SCoT), for its evaluation as a potential marker system in coconut. SCoT markers were utilized for assessment of genetic diversity in 23 coconut accessions (10 talls and 13 dwarfs), representing different geographical regions. Out of 25 SCoT primers screened, 15 primers were selected for this study based on their consistent amplification patterns. A total of 102 scorable bands were produced by the 15 primers, 88 % of which were polymorphic. The scored data were used to construct a similarity matrix. The similarity coefficient values ranged between 0.37 and 0.91. These coefficients were utilized to construct a dendrogram using the unweighted pair group of arithmetic means (UPGMA). The extent of genetic diversity observed based on SCoT analysis of coconut accessions was comparable to earlier findings using other marker systems. Tall and dwarf coconut accessions were clearly demarcated, and in general, coconut accessions from the same geographical region clustered together. The results indicate the potential of SCoT markers to be utilized as molecular markers to detect DNA polymorphism in coconut accessions.

Introduction
Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.), belonging to the family Arecaceae, is the only reported species under the genus Cocos. In the major growing countries in Asia, it is grown as both as a homestead as well as a plantation crop over large areas. Coconut palms are found abundantly in coastal regions of most tropical islands, significantly contributing to the sustenance of fragile island ecosystems and the livelihood of people. Considering the versatile role of coconut palms in providing food, nutrition, fibers, beverage, medicine, shelter, and wide range of handicrafts (from different parts of the palm) throughout its lifetime, the coconut palm is termed as ‘Kalpavriksha’ meaning ‘tree of heaven’ or ‘tree of life’.

Tall (‘typica’) and dwarf (‘nana’) are two main categories of coconut palms. The Talls are naturally cross-pollinating types, have more economic value, are vigorous growing, comparatively late to flowering and the fruits are with intermediate colors of brown, green, yellow, orange among individual palms. Dwarfs, in contrast, are naturally self-pollinating types with reduced growth habitat, early flowering and produce large number of medium to small, distinctly colored (green or yellow or orange or brown) fruits (Dasanayaka et al. 2009). Many efforts are ongoing in coconut-growing countries to conserve the rich natural diversity existing in coconut germplasm collections for further utilization in crop improvement programs so that it becomes a more profitable crop for small-farm holders, who constitute the vast majority of coconut growers (Batugal et al. 2005). As a first step towards this goal, assessment of genetic diversity assumes significance for germplasm conservation and their subsequent utilization.

The repertoire of markers utilized for characterizing genetic diversity in coconut can be categorized into morphological, biochemical and DNA-based. Morphological traits like seed germination time (Bourdeix et al. 1993), fruit component analysis (Harries 1978), floral biology and pollination behavior (Sangare et al. 1978; Ratnambal et al. 2003), foliar traits (N’Cho et al. 1993; Arunachalam et al. 2005) and biochemical parameters like foliar polyphenols (Jay et al. 1989), proteins (Cardena et al. 1998) and isozymes (Benoit and Ghesquiere 1984) have formed the basis of many studies in coconut diversity analysis. However, morphological and biochemical markers possess many drawbacks like being limited in number, show modest levels of polymorphism and low heritability and can be influenced by developmental stages of the plant and varied environmental factors. DNA-based markers can overcome the limitations of the above marker systems. DNA-based markers used in coconut include RAPD (Ashburner et al. 1997; Upadhyay et al. 2004; Ritto et al. 2008), RFLP (Lebrun et al. 1998), AFLP (Perera et al. 1998; Teulat et al. 2000), ISTR (Rohde et al. 1995), ISSR (Manimekalai and Nagarajan 2006a) and SSRs (Perera et al. 1999; Rivera et al. 1999; Merrow et al. 2003; Rajesh et al. 2008a, b). These markers have been applied for assessment of genetic diversity within coconut germplasm, construction of linkage maps for mapping genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling agronomically important traits (Baudouin et al. 2006; Herran et al. 2000) and trait identification (Rajesh et al. 2013).

Recent advances in genomic research has resulted in a change of preference from the use of random DNA markers to gene-targeted, functional markers and the development of novel DNA-based marker systems (Gupta and Rustgi 2004; Poczai et al. 2013). The development of functional markers has been simplified by an explosion of resources in public genomic databases (Andersen and Lubberstedt 2003). Molecular markers developed from the transcribed region of the genome have the ability to reveal polymorphism, which might be directly related to gene function (Poczai et al. 2013). Start codon targeted polymorphism (SCoT) is a simple and novel marker system first described by Collard and Mackill (2009), which is based on the short conserved region flanking the ATG translation start codon in plant genes. The technique uses single primers designed to anneal to the flanking regions of the ATG initiation codon on both DNA strands. SCoT polymorphism marker technique has been successfully applied in rice (Collard and Mackill 2009), peanut (Xiong et al. 2010), longan (Chen et al. 2010), mango (Luo et al. 2010, 2011), citrus (Han et al. 2011), grapes (Zhang et al. 2011), potato (Gorji et al. 2011), persimmon (Deng et al. 2012), orchids (Bhattacharyya et al. 2013), Jatropa (Mulpuri et al. 2013), tritordeum (Cabo et al. 2014) and sugarcane (Que et al. 2014). In the current study, we have used SCoT markers to assess the extent of genetic diversity in a worldwide collection of coconut germplasm accessions with an aim of evaluating the efficiency of the marker system in coconut. This is the first report on the use of SCoT markers in analyzing coconut germplasm for genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships.

Materials and methods
Plant material and DNA extraction
A total of 23 coconut accessions, comprising 10 tall and 13 dwarf accessions, representing different geographical regions, were used for this study (Table 1). Fresh spindle leaves were collected from four palms per accession, which are conserved at field gene banks of Central Plantation Crops Research Institute of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)—a National Active Germplasm Site for coconut. DNA was extracted from the total of 96 samples using a modified SDS method as described by Rajesh et al. (2013). The quantity and quality of extracted DNA were verified using the spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA from four palms of each accession was pooled together thus making a total of 23 DNA samples. Extracted DNA was stored at −20 °C till further use.Table 1 List of coconut accessions used for the present study

SCoT marker analysis
All SCoT primers were synthesized from SIGMA (India). Twenty-five SCoT primers (SCoT 1–SCoT 25) described by Collard and Mackill (2009) were initially screened for polymorphism and reproducibility in a subset of six accessions, three each of talls and dwarfs. PCR amplification of these primers was carried out in a thermal cycler in 20 µl volume, with the reaction mixture containing 2 µl of 10× PCR buffer, 0.4 µl dNTPs (10 mM), 1.6 µl primer (10 µM), 0.3 µl Taq DNA polymerase (3U/µl), and 3 µl template DNA (10 ng/µl) and 12.7 µl distilled water. Cycling conditions in a thermal cycler (DNA engine: BIORAD) were: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 34 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min and final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. All primers were amplified using the same procedure. After amplification, PCR products were mixed with 3 µl of 6× gel loading dye (0.25 % bromophenol blue, 0.25 % xylene cyanol FF, 30 % glycerol in water) and separated on 1.5 % agarose gel in 1× TBE buffer by electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 µg/ml). A 1 Kb ladder (MBI Fermentas) was used as a molecular size standard. Gels were visualized in a gel documentation system (Bio-Rad). All experiments were repeated twice.

Data analysis
Only clear and reproducible PCR amplified products from SCoT primer were used for further analysis. The bands were scored as absent (0) or present (1). Software package NTSYS-pc version 2.0 (Rohlf 1993) was used for the further analysis using the scoring results. Genetic similarity analysis between tall and dwarf accessions of coconut was estimated using similarity matrix, generated by calculating Jaccard’s similarity coefficient. These similarity coefficients were then used for cluster analysis and a dendrogram was constructed by the unweighted pair-group method (UPGMA) (Sneath and Sokal 1973). WINBOOT software (Yap and Nelson 1996) was used for the assessment of robustness of the dendrogram typology and the estimation of robustness of cluster analysis.

The average polymorphism information content (PIC) was calculated by applying the formula given by Powell et al. (1996): PIC=1-Σfi2, where i = 1 − n where fi is the frequency of the ith allele. The number of alleles refers to the number of scored bands. The frequency of an allele was obtained by dividing the number of accessions where it was found by the total number of accessions. The PIC value provides an estimate of the discriminating power of a marker.

Results
Polymorphism detected using SCoT markers
Out of 25 primers tested, 15 primers were chosen for further studies based on clarity of the banding patterns (Table 2). The number of bands generated among the 23 coconut accessions using these 15 primers was 102, which ranged from 3 (SCoT 17) to 11 (SCoT 14), with an average of 6.8 bands/primer. Out of these fragments scored, 89 (87.2 %) were polymorphic. Seven of the primers gave 100 % polymorphism, indicating the capability of SCoT primers to detect high levels of polymorphism among coconut accessions (Table 2). The PIC value ranged from 0.16 (SCoT 4) to 0.47 (SCoT 17).Table 2 Sequence of SCoT primers, the number of scorable polymorphic bands and polymorphism information content (PIC) of each primer

Genetic diversity analysis among the coconut accessions
The scored bands were used to calculate the genetic diversity among the 23 coconut accessions. The genetic similarity coefficient between the pair samples was evaluated by calculating the Jaccard’s similarity coefficient based on the proportion of shared bands. The pairwise similarity coefficient was lowest (0.37) between CCNT (a tall accession that originated from Vietnam) and KTOD (a dwarf accession from India). The maximum genetic similarity (0.91) was observed between the two dwarf accessions originating from Malaysia, viz. MYD and MOD (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Similarity matrix among 23 coconut accessions based on SCoT markers based on Jaccard’s coefficient



Cluster analysis
A dendrogram constructed using corresponding genetic similarity coefficients obtained from UPGMA analysis was used to determine the clustering pattern among the coconut accessions analysis (Fig. 2). Two main clusters (designated ‘A’ and ‘B’) were formed diverging at the similarity coefficient of 0.48. The cluster (‘A’) was a large one comprising 21 accessions. Within this cluster (A), there were two sub-clusters (designated ‘a1’ and ‘a2’). Sub-cluster ‘a1’ had a single cluster—comprising two tall accessions that originated from Southeast Asia, viz. CCNT (Vietnam) and PHOT (The Philippines). The second cluster within sub-cluster ‘a2’ had further five clusters (designated ‘a21’ to ‘a25’), which showed a clear separation of tall and dwarf accessions. The first sub-cluster ‘a21’ comprised two Southeast Asian tall accessions that originated, viz. Borneo tall (Indonesia) and San Ramon tall (The Philippines). Cluster ‘a22’ had grouping of four accessions, viz. ADGT and ADOT (from Andaman Islands, India), KWGT (from Malaysia) and West Coast tall (India). All the dwarf accessions formed three clusters; a23, a24 and a25. Cluster ‘a23’ comprised three dwarfs CGD and COD (from India) and CRD (from Africa) were placed within the first sub-cluster, the Malaysian (MOD and MYD) and Sri Lankan Dwarfs (SLRD and SLGD) were placed in the second sub-cluster along with GDGD (from India) and the two Pacific Ocean dwarfs (NKOD and HPOD) were placed in the third sub-cluster. Cluster ‘a24’ had a unique accession, NLAD (from Fiji) and cluster ‘a25’ had two Indian dwarfs, viz. KTOD and GBGD. The second main cluster (‘B’), a distinct one, had two tall accessions from Lakshadweep Islands, India, viz. LCT and LMMT. The clades were supported by reliable bootstrap values (Fig. 2).Fig. 2 Dendrogram generated from genetic similarity, using Jaccard’s coefficient and UPGMA clustering method of 23 coconut accessions based on SCoT analysis.

Discussion
A thorough knowledge on genetic relationships among coconut accessions is needed for adopting effective conservation strategies, germplasm utilization and management of the collections. Characterization of coconut germplasm accessions by morphological descriptors or biochemical markers alone have inherent limitations in providing a precise picture of genetic variation. A molecular marker-based assessment across coconut populations in different geographical locations, prior to collecting germplasm for conservation, would form a well-organized strategy for identifying unique populations with specific relevance for utilization in breeding programmes. DNA marker-based assessment of genetic diversity has been utilized by many researchers to assess the extent of genetic diversity among coconut germplasm accessions. A majority of the marker systems utilized, viz. RAPD, DAF, ISSR and AFLP are random, arbitrarily amplified DNA markers. The major advantage of these systems of markers is that there is no need for prior genome sequence of the organism under study. These markers, mostly dominant ones, are generated randomly over the whole genome (multi-loci) and the techniques are non-expensive, technically simple and are capable of generating a relatively large number of markers per sample (Poczai et al. 2013). In spite of these advantages, these techniques are also characterized by a host of weaknesses (Simmons et al. 2007). Since their development, microsatellite markers have been the markers of choice for coconut genetic diversity studies for quite some time. Even though microsatellite markers have numerous advantages, a good separation of alleles is still difficult to achieve using polyacrylamide gels when compared to automated capillary electrophoresis systems. Various other factors also influence the choice of marker system being used, some of them being the availability of technical expertise, equipment and funding (Collard and Mackill 2009).

With the advancements in the field of genomics, novel, gene-targeted functional markers, which possess gene or promoter elements, are gaining prominence and these markers have been reported to offer increased resolution and reproducibility (Poczai et al. 2013). These functional markers, derived from polymorphic sequences, might possibly to be involved in phenotypic trait variation (Andersen and Lubberstedt 2003). One such marker is SCoT, which was based on the observation that short conserved regions of plant genes are bordered by ATG translation start codon (Sawant et al. 1999). Based on this observation, single primers were designed which could anneal to the flanking regions of the ATG initiation codon existing on both DNA strands. The technique is similar to RAPD or ISSR in that a single primer acts as the forward and the reverse primer, amplicons can be visualized by standard agarose gel electrophoresis, without the need for costly automated electrophoresis systems (Collard and Mackill 2009). The higher primer lengths and subsequently higher annealing temperatures ensure higher reproducibility of SCoT markers, compared to RAPD markers. Since its discovery, SCoT markers have been utilized for characterizing genetic diversity in a variety of plant species (Collard and Mackill 2009; Xiong et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2010; Luo et al. 2010, 2011; Han et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2011; Gorji et al. 2011; Deng et al. 2012; Bhattacharyya et al. 2013; Mulpuri et al. 2013; Cabo et al. 2014; Que et al. 2014).

The results of the present study, using 23 coconut accessions and 15 SCoT primers, indicated that 87.2 % of the scored fragments were polymorphic, which was relatively high compared to earlier studies utilizing dominant marker systems like RAPD (Upadhyay et al. 2004; Manimekalai and Nagarajan 2006b) and ISSR (Manimekalai and Nagarajan 2006a). Seven of the primers gave 100 % polymorphism in the 23 samples, making them comparable to polymorphism observed with SSR markers (Perera et al. 1999; Rivera et al. 1999; Merrow et al. 2003; Rajesh et al. 2008a, b, 2014). Pair wise similarity coefficient’s ranged from 0.37 to 0.91 indicating the capability of SCoT markers to detect high levels of genetic diversity among the coconut accessions analyzed. The PIC values were also much higher compared to earlier studies in coconut using RAPD markers (Manimekalai and Nagarajan 2006b).

Cluster analysis revealed grouping of coconut accessions in accordance with both their breeding habit (‘talls’ or ‘dwarfs’) and also their geographical origins. A lot of earlier studies, utilizing molecular markers, have revealed genetic distinctiveness of tall and dwarf coconut accessions, which is mainly due to the differences their allogamous/autogamous breeding behaviors (Perera et al. 1999; Rivera et al. 1999; Teulat et al. 2000). The autogamous dwarf coconut accessions display less phenotypic diversity (Zizumbo-Villarreal and Piñero 1998; Arunachalam et al. 2005) and genetic diversity in contrast to allogamous talls. Lebrun et al. (2005) have reported that regardless of their geographical origins, all dwarf coconut accessions form a genetically uniform group, under the Pacific group and the sub-group Southeast Asia. The present study with SCoT markers also corroborates the above observation. The clustering pattern based on SCoT markers also indicated that the dwarf accessions formed an uniform group within the tall accessions. Perera et al. (2000) had hypothesized the possibility that dwarf coconut accessions had evolved from a small number of tall palms because almost all the alleles present in dwarf coconut accessions were shared by tall accessions.

Tall coconut accessions have been divided into two major cultivar groups—the Pacific group and the Indo-Atlantic group (Lebrun et al. 2005). Tall coconut accessions from the same region, given their allogamous nature, might possess a comparatively similar genetic structure (Lebrun et al. 2005). Consequently, an obvious pattern of variation is expected and has been reported in many studies (Lebrun et al. 1998; Perera et al. 2000). In the present study, clustering of tall coconut accessions, according to the geographical proximities, was observed, which is in line with earlier studies using microsatellite markers (Perera et al. 2000; Rivera et al. 1999). Interestingly, the two accessions from Lakshadweep Islands (India), viz. LCT and LMMT, formed a distinct cluster. The region around the southern margins of the Indian sub-continent, comprising Lakshadweep Islands, Sri Lanka and Maldives, represent a possible center of coconut domestication (Gunn et al. 2011) and may explain the uniqueness of these two accessions.

In contrast to talls, dwarfs, being autogamous, are inclined to conserve their genetic structure regardless of the region of location. The genetic structure of dwarf accessions, therefore, is an indication of their region of origin, viz. Southeast Asia, rather than the region, which they are presently found, in spite of their growing there for an extended time (Lebrun et al. 2005). SCoT analyses revealed close relationships among the dwarf accessions from India (CGD and COD), Malaysia (MYD and MOD), Sri Lanka (SLRD and SLGD) and the Pacific Ocean region (NKOD and NLAD). Amongst dwarf accessions analyzed, one exception was NLAD, which occupied a unique position in the cluster when compared to other dwarfs when analyzed using SCoT markers. NLAD, in spite of being a dwarf, is allogamous and had showed highest diversity amongst a set of dwarf samples analyzed using microsatellites (Merrow et al. 2003) and foliar traits (Arunachalam et al. 2005).

This study indicates that SCoT markers are informative and could be used to detect polymorphism among coconut germplasm accessions. The SCoT markers could either be used individually or in combination with other molecular markers to assess genetic diversity of coconut germplasm and to obtain reliable information about population structure across coconut populations, which would aid strategies for effective collection of coconut germplasm, their conservation in genebanks and in grouping them for making further selections as well as removing duplicates.

Dried and sieved soils were contaminated with 5 ml each of crude oil with replicates and inoculated with earthworms and monitored daily for 12 weeks. Physicochemical parameters such as pH, total organic carbon, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium were determined using standard procedures. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) was determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS), while BTEX constituents and earthworms tissues were analyzed using Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). The results showed that the earthworm significantly enhanced the physicochemical parameters of the contaminated soil resulting in a decrease of the total organic carbon (56.64 %), sulfate (57.66 %), nitrate (57.69 %), phosphate (57.73 %), sodium (57.69 %), potassium (57.68 %), calcium (57.69 %) and magnesium (57.68 %) except pH (3.90 %) that slightly increased. There was a significant decrease in the TPH (84.99 %), benzene (91.65 %), toluene (100.00 %), ethylbenzene (100.00 %) and xylene (100.00 %). Analyses of the tissues of the earthworm at the end of the experiment showed that the earthworms bioaccumulated/biodegraded 57.35/27.64 % TPH, 38.91/52.73 % benzene, 27.76/72.24 % toluene, 42.16/57.85 % ethylbenzene and 09.62/90.38 % xylene. The results showed that the earthworms H. africanus could be used to bioremediate moderately polluted soil with crude oil contamination in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.

Introduction
The petroleum industry in Nigeria is the largest in the West African region and the second largest in Africa after Algeria. Nigeria has a total of 159 oil fields and 1481 wells in operation (NDES 1997). According to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) 2013 Annual Statistical Bulletin on the oil and gas industry, a total crude oil and condensate production for the year was 852,776,653 barrels, giving a daily average of 2.27 million barrels per day (mb/day). These figures put Nigeria in the fifteenth position in relation to the global oil producing nation and the sixth largest exporter of crude oil worldwide (NNPC 2013).

All activities surrounding the oil sector such as exploration, drilling, transportation, refining and consumption of oil and its associated products result in the spilling of oil and refine products into the environment. In 2013 alone, the NNPC reported a total of 2256 line breaks on NNPC pipelines resulting in a loss of 181.67 million tonnes (mt) of petroleum products worth about N21.48 billion, with 34 cases of fire incidents during the year under review (NNPC 2013).

Crude oil contains a wide range of compounds which are largely toxic to humans and the environment. Some authors have suggested that soil remediation standards should be based on the BTEX components in crude oil and oil products (fuels)-impacted soils (Salanitro et al. 1997). Although BTEX are known to vapourize in contaminated sites, they can remain locked in soil for months and even years as reported by the United Nations Environment Program assessment in Ogoniland (UNEP 2011), hence they need special attention in crude oil-contaminated soil. Each of these compounds or their combination poses a serious concern to human health, living organisms and the environment. Benzene is a notorious cause of bone marrow failure. Substantial quantities of epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data link benzene to aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, and bone marrow abnormalities (Kasper et al. 2004) and myelodysplastic syndrome (Smith 2010). Human exposure to benzene is a global health problem. Benzene targets liver, kidney, lung, heart and the brain and can cause DNA strand breaks, chromosomal damage, etc. Benzene causes cancer in animals including humans and has been shown to cause cancer in both sexes of multiple species of laboratory animals exposed via various routes (Huff 2007; Rana and Verma 2005). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has classified benzene as a known human carcinogen for all routes of exposure (EPA 2012). The central nervous system (CNS) is the primary target organ for toluene toxicity in both humans and animals for acute and chronic exposures (EPA 2012). Animal studies have reported effects on the blood, liver, and kidneys from chronic inhalation exposure to ethylbenzene. Exposure to ethylbenzene by inhalation resulted in an increased incidence of kidney and testicular tumors in rats, and lung and liver tumors in mice (EPA 2000). Ethylbenzene is classified as a possible carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC 2012).

Beside, the use of chemicals and mechanical methods for cleaning oil in the environment, one of the most promising bioremediation technologies is the use of earthworms in a processed specifically known as vermiremediation.

The idea to use earthworms in vermicomposting of gardens and crop enhancement has been known for centuries, but its application in bioremediation according to available records was incidentally discovered after the Seveso chemical plant explosion in 1976 in Italy, when a vast area was contaminated with extremely toxic chemical such as 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Several fauna perished except for some species of the earthworms that survived. Earthworms which ingested TCDD-contaminated soils were shown to bioaccumulate dioxin in their tissues and concentrated it on an average of 14.5-fold (Satchell 1983).

Several researches have established the potentials of earthworms to bioremediate crude oil and other petrochemicals from laboratory and field trials polluted soil. Ma et al. (1995) studied the influence of earthworm species Lumbricus rubellus on the disappearance of spiked PAHs, phenanthrene and fluoranthene (100 μg/kg of soil), and found that the losses of both PAHs occurred at a faster rate in soils with earthworms than the soil without worms. After 56 days (8 weeks), 86 % of the phenanthrene was removed.

Other studies have also shown that oil-polluted soils can be efficiently bioremediated, leading to a reduction of toxic potency (Van Gestel et al. 2001). Martin-Gil et al. (2007) also studied the use of earthworm Eisenia fetida and vermicomposting in the treatment of high-molecular weight hydrocarbons asphaltenes from the prestige oil spill. Earthworms mineralized the asphaltenes, thus eliminating it from the system. Sinha et al. (2008) studied the remedial action of earthworms on PAHs contaminated soils obtained from a former gasworks site in Brisbane, Australia. Results showed that the earthworms could remove nearly 80 % of the PAHs as compared to just 47 and 21 % where it was not used and only microbial degradation occurred. Ameh et al. (2013) investigated the use of earthworms (Eudriluseugeniae) for vermi-assisted bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated mechanic workshop soils. After 35 days of treatment, earthworm inoculation affected a higher drop in total petroleum hydrocarbon contents as compared to the samples without worms, indicating that earthworms may be used as biocatalysts in the bioremediation process.

Hyperiodrilusafricanus is a species of earthworms widely distributed in humid tropical Africa (Lavelle et al. 1999). Populations of this species are found throughout West (Ivory Coast, Nigeria) and Central Africa (Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola) both in natural and disturbed areas derived from humid savannas and forests (Madge 1969; Omodeo 1954; Tondoh and Lavelle 2005).

Although other species of earthworms have been used for bioremediation, literature on the bioremediation of crude oil with earthworms H. africanus is not available, hence this study seeks to determine the effectiveness of hydrocarbon degrading potentials of the earthworm H.africanus on crude oil-contaminated soil and to determine the fate of the contaminant taken by the earthworms, if they are bioaccumulated or biodegraded in the tissues of the earthworms.

Materials and methods
Test substrate
Top soil not exceeding a depth of five inches after clearing the vegetation cover was dug with a shovel and collected into a bucket besides the Botanical Garden, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Benin. The collected soil was sun-dried by spreading it on a flat, clean board surface for 48 h. The dried soil was sieved using a 5 mm mesh plastic filter according to ISO standard 11268-1 (ISO 1993) to remove debris and large stones.

Test organisms
The earthworms used for the experiment were collected around the main campus of the University of Benin immediately after rainfall while crawling around to seek shelter. All earthworms were held in a holding facility for days prior to the experiment for acclimatization purposes and were regularly checked on a daily basis to ascertain their health condition. Prior to the experiment, earthworms were identified by Stephen Owa, using methods described by Owa (1992). The crude oil used for the experiment was obtained from Chevron Escravos Terminal, Delta State, Nigeria.

Experimental design
Four rectangular containers with cover lid and clips on both sides of the edges measuring 20 × 9 × 12 cm were purchased from the market. The containers were weighed with a Digital Sensitive Weighing balance (Scoute SE-410X0.019, Ohaus Computer, USA) and were properly labeled using tape and a permanent marker. 1 kg (ISO 1993) of the sun-dried soil was then weighed into each of the four containers using Camry Emperors scale manufactured by Dial Spring Scale, China. With the aid of a 10 ml glass beaker, 5 ml of crude oil was thoroughly mixed, into each of the four containers having 1 kg each of soil and were moistened with distilled water to the water holding capacity of the soil. The treatments with crude oil-contaminated soil were left to stay for 7 days in the laboratory exposed to the elements.

After 7 days, cow dung was freshly collected within the campus and about 50 g each of the cow dung weighed was thoroughly mixed into the containers with crude oil-contaminated soil.

Immediately after the addition of additives, earthworms were sorted out of the holding containers, washed with clean water and ten earthworms of the species H. africanus measured and weighed were inoculated into the crude oil-contaminated soil and the replicates except the control. A netting material cut into sizes was placed on top of each of the containers and the cover lid frame was placed on top of it to hold it firmly with the help of the clips on both sides of the containers. This is done to avoid escape of the earthworms and allow free flow of oxygen into the treatments. The setup was placed inside the laboratory and checked morning and evening on a daily basis.

Laboratory analyses
Prior to the contamination of the soil and after contamination, samples were collected with a spatula, placed in an aluminum foil, labeled and taken to a laboratory to determine the physicochemical parameters of the soil, total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and the benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) constituents.

For every 30 days, samples of the contaminated soil from each of the treatments were collected for laboratory analyses. For each of the contaminated soils, the physicochemical parameters such as pH, total organic carbon, sulfate, nitrate and phosphate, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium were determined using procedures by the AOAC (2005). The TPH was determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) as described by Miroslav and Vladimir (1999) while BTEX constituents in the crude oil (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4) contaminated soil were determined using Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) from Agilent Technologies Inc., United States. At the termination of the experiment, earthworms were analyzed to determine the TPH and BTEX in the tissues using GC-FID.Fig. 1 Crude oil

Results
Death and survival of earthworms
At the termination of the experiment, no death was recorded in the population of the earthworm species used for the study.

Physicochemical parameters
The physicochemical parameters showed a variation within 90 days of the experiment. There was a gradual increased in the pH of the contaminated soil with inoculation of earthworm after 30, 60 and 90 days, (0.93, 2.78 and 3.90 %) respectively compared to the control where there is a decrease. There was a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the crude oil-contaminated soil after inoculation of H. africanus within 30, 60 and 90 days in the total organic carbon (3.47, 9.25, 56.64 %), sulfate (3.88, 37.63, 57.66 %), nitrate (3.86, 37.63, 57.69 %), phosphate (3.74, 37.61, 57.73 %), sodium (3.89, 37.57, 57.69 %), potassium (3.91, 37.78, 57.68 %), calcium (3.91, 37.68, 57.69 %) and magnesium (4.06, 37.68, 57.68 %) compared to the control without earthworms with a 10.55 % decrease after 90 days of the study (Fig. 5).Fig. 5 Physicochemical parameters of crude oil-contaminated soil with earthworms



Total petroleum hydrocarbon bioremediation
Total petroleum hydrocarbon content in crude oil-contaminated soil with H. africanus decreased significantly (P < 0.05, F = 16,503.64) after 30, 60 and 90 days of the experiment by 22.01, 44.29 and 68.29 %, respectively, but in the control, it only decreased by 11.87 % (Fig. 6).Fig. 6 TPH in crude oil-contaminated soil with H. africanus




Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene bioremediation
Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene decreased with inoculation of H. africanus into crude oil-contaminated soil (Fig. 7). Benzene decreased by 3.65, 50.60 and 84.73 % (F = 181,785.77, P < 0.05), toluene by 10.79, 75.95 and 100.00 % (F = 3242.62, P < 0.05), ethylbenzene by 5.72, 78.24 and 100.00 % (F = 5217.28, P < 0.05) and xylene by 37.26, 66.16 and 100.00 % (F = 2484.56, P < 0.05) after 30, 60 and 90 days of the study.Fig. 7 Bioremediation of BTEX in contaminated soil with earthworms



Bioaccumulation/biodegradation of TPH and BTEX
Analyses of the tissues of the earthworms, H. africanus at the end of the study showed that the earthworms bioaccumulated 58.05 % TPH, 48.42 % benzene, 31.86 % toluene, 63.20 % ethylbenzene and 18.14 % xylene in crude oil-contaminated soil.

To calculate the percentage biodegraded, the formula below was adopted: BiodC=IC-FC-TC where BiodC is the concentration of pollutant biodegraded at the end of the experiment, IC is the initial concentration of pollutant at the beginning of the experiment, FC is the final concentration of pollutant at the end of the experiment, and TC is the concentration in the tissues of the earthworms at the end of the experiment

The results revealed that the earthworms, H. africanus, biodegraded 10.24 % TPH, 36.34 % benzene, 68.14 % toluene, 36.80 % ethylbenzene and 81.86 % xylene (Fig. 8).Fig. 8 Bioaccumulation/biodegradation of TPH and BTEX in earthworms



Discussion
Bioremediation has become a universally acceptable technology for the removal of a wide range of contaminants, especially generated from the petrochemical industries from the environment.

In this present study, all the earthworms survived the concentration (5 ml) of crude oil contaminated into the 1 kg of soil and significantly degraded the TPH and BTEX hydrocarbons in the media.

Ameh et al. (2011) reported 100 % survival of earthworms in 150 g of used engine oil. At the end of our study, earthworms re-introduced into non-polluted soil continue their normal activities. The idea that some workers have used more than 5 ml of oil in other regions of the world where heavy and sour crude oil is available led to the first attempt to use 10 ml for the experiment. This was the thinking based on the fact that the Nigerian crude oil is light and maybe less toxic, but such concentration resulted in the death of the earthworms in less than 48 h. This agrees with the findings of Dorn and Salanitro (2000) which reported that light oil was the most toxic oil in their study. Heavy oils were least toxic showing LC50s of 100 % or greater after 2 ± 3 months time in either soil. The light oil in the soils was significantly more toxic than medium and heavy oils (Dorn and Salanitro 2000).

Earthworms commonly found in agricultural fields thrive at neutral pH, but can tolerate a pH from 5.0 to 8.0, (Duiker and Stehouwer 2008). The pH of the soil decreased from 5.85 to 5.39 after contamination and gradually increased from 5.39 to 5.60 after inoculation of earthworms. It is a favoured opinion that the activities of earthworms in soil tend to bring the pH towards neutrality. The increase in pH is probably due to the pH buffering action of organic molecules produced in the gut of earthworms (Duiker and Stehouwer 2008) in the bioremediation process. It is possible that since the pH is still within the tolerable range (Edwards and Aracon 2006) for the survival and normal functioning of the earthworms, it is not a neutral approach at the end of the study. Sandor and Schrader (2012) observed that as a general trend, the recorded pH values were higher at the end of the experiments compared to the initial start value. Azarpira et al. (2013) reported that the pH value at final stage was increased for all the treatments as compared to initial stage for the vermicomposting process with E. eugeniae.

There was a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in total organic carbon, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium with a decrease towards restoring the normal conditions of the soil to the background levels prior to contamination of soil. Ceccanti et al. (2006) on the combination of earthworms and compost for the ecological remediation of hydrocarbon polluted soil in Finland reported that the chemical parameters showed a decrease in the concentration of total carbon, total phosphorus, and the available carbon and nitrogen in all the treatments. This suggests a progressive degradation of organic compounds, probably including the pollutants (Ceccanti et al. 2006). Although at the end of our study, only phosphate was restored back to the initial background levels of soil.

TOC slightly increased after crude oil contamination of soil and decreased (1.73–0.75) after inoculation with H. africanus below the background levels at the end of the experiment. The reason for the further decrease is not clear, but it is probable that the earthworms needed some degree of TOC in the biodegradation process of breaking down pollutant in the crude oil-contaminated soil. Edwards and Arancon (2006) stated that breakdown of compost materials results in low C:N ratios. Sandor and Schrader (2012) reported a significant decrease in soil organic carbon at the end of their experiment. Azarpira et al. (2013) reported that as compared to initial stage, organic carbon decreased in the final stage. The combined action of earthworms and gut microorganisms may be responsible for the loss of organic carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (Prakash and Karmegam 2010). Azizi et al. (2013) also recorded reduction in organic carbon during vermicomposting of sludge. They explained that loss in organic carbon was due to the use of organic carbon by earthworms and microorganisms as source of energy. Similar trend was also reported by Kennette et al. (2002) with Lumbricusterrestris, Ceccanti et al. (2006) with E. fetida and Ameh et al. (2011) with L.terrestris, while Singer et al. (2001), Schaefer et al. (2005), Iordache and Borza (2012) and Ameh et al. (2013) reported higher values.

Sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium in soil increase significantly after crude oil contamination and decrease significantly after inoculation of earthworms. These soil nutrients are required in the right proportions for the proper functioning of soil fertility for agricultural purposes. At the end of the experiment, these parameters were higher than the initial background levels prior to the experiment. The increase above the background levels is an indication that the earthworm was able to stabilize the soil from a moderately fertile soil to a fertile soil needed for soil flora and fuana. Sinha et al. (2009) reported that the earthworm increases these minerals in the soil by enhancing the soil quality and nutrients. Similar trend was reported by Zavala-Cruz et al. (2013) on crude oil-contaminated soil with earthworms in Mexico. Manyuchi et al. (2013) reported an increase in soil potassium content after 25 days period, but in contrast Sandor and Schrader (2012) reported a significantly lower amount of nitrates compared to those in the corresponding control treatments at the end of their experiment while Iordache and Borza (2011) stated that the concentrations of nitrates and nitrites decreased with 6.93 and 21.43 %, respectively, which are attributed to earthworms, because they consume large amounts of nitrogen in their digestion.

TPH was not detected in the soil prior to contamination. At the end of the study, the TPH in the contaminated soil with earthworms decreased significantly by 68.29 % but for the control without earthworm it only decreased by 11.87 %. There is yet no clear understanding of the biochemical pathway for the bioaccumulation or breakdown of organic compounds in earthworms, but it may not be unconnected with the interactions of chemicals such as enzymes secreted by the earthworms and the decomposer microbial flora associated with the gut of earthworms (Sinha et al. 2010). Schaefer et al. (2005) reported that the TPH concentration decreased significantly in samples with L. terrestris, E. fetida within 28 days. Schaefer and Filser (2007) also conducted an experiment on the influence of earthworms (E. fetida, Allolobophora chlorotica, and L. terrestris) and organic additives on the biodegradation of oil-contaminated soil (9500 mg TPH/kg soil dry wt.) in Germany. GC analyses showed that the concentration of TPH was significantly reduced in soils with earthworms compared to the treatments without worms. The efficiency of oil degradation depended on earthworm species. They suggested that earthworms could be applied in the later stages of the bioremediation of even highly contaminated sites, when TPH concentrations and potential toxicity have been decreased to a tolerable or moderate level. Earthworms might be especially useful in in situ remediation by the so-called natural attenuation where the soil is not disturbed by heavy machinery (Schaefer and Filser 2007). Other workers that reported decrease in TPH or crude oil include Schaefer (2001), Ceccanti et al. (2006), Tomoko et al. (2005), Getliff et al. (2002), while Callaham et al. (2002) reported no effect.

Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) were below detection limits in the uncontaminated soil. After contamination, the values in the BTEX constituents were in the following descending order; Benzene > Toluene > Xylene > Ethylbenzene in the contaminated soil. The BTEX constituent decreases accordingly after inoculation of earthworms after 30 and 60 days. Only benzene was detected in the soil at the end of the study, while toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene were below detection limit. Hutchins et al. (1992) and Junfeng et al. (2008) also reported a significant reduction in BTEX in petrochemical-contaminated soils. Hutchins et al. (1992) reported average benzene breakthrough of 74.3 ± 5.8 %, 75.9 ± 12.1 %, and 63.1 ± 9.6 % in the columns with limited oxygen, limited oxygen plus nitrate, and nitrate alone, respectively. Junfeng et al. (2008) suggested that all the BTEX substrates could be anaerobically biodegraded to non-detectable levels within 70 days when the initial concentrations were below 100 mg/kg in soil. Toluene was degraded faster than any other BTEX compounds, and the high-to-low order of degradation rates were toluene > ethylbenzene > m-xylene > o-xylene > benzene > p-xylene (Junfeng et al. 2008). Contreras-Ramos et al. (2006) reported PAH removal of 51 % for anthracene, 47 % for benzo(a)pyrene and 100 % for phenanthrene in soil with the earthworm E. fetida. Krishna et al. (2011) also reported 100 % bioremediation of phenols after 96 h with the earthworms E.fetida, E.eugeniae and Anantapur sp. for phenol concentration of 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 ppm. Tharakan et al (2004) investigated the biotransformation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB’s) in sludge and sediment from the Ralston Street Lagoon (RSL) SUPERFUND site in Gary, Indiana, United States with E. fetida. Vermicomposting bioreactors (VBs) were established with mass fractions of contaminated sludge ranging from 10 to 75 %. All sludge concentrations demonstrated around an 80 % reduction in total PCB concentration by the time of termination of the experiment. Singer et al. (2001) achieved 55 % removal of the total soil PCB with Pheretimahawayana as compared to only 39 % in identically treated soils without earthworms. Earthworm-treated soils achieved upwards of 65 % PCB degradation at subsurface depths, as compared to 44 % in soils without earthworms.

In bioremediation studies with macrofauna, it is essential to point out the transport and fate of the contaminant. This will give a clear understanding of the bioremediation pathway and the need to take extra steps towards effective removal of the contaminant from the food chain. Although a significant amount of TPH and BTEX were lost from the soil and biodegraded by the earthworm, at the end of the experiment about 57.35 % of TPH and 29.61 % of BTEX were bioaccumulated inside the tissues of the earthworms while 15.01 % TPH and 8.35 % benzene were still remaining in the soil. Tharakan et al. (2004) reported that the bulk of the removal of PCBs from the sludge appeared to be transported into the earthworm biomass. Approximately, 20 % of the PCBs remained in the sludge-earthworm bedding mixture at the time of termination of each of the experimental studies. As suggested by Tharakan et al. (2004), it is entirely possible that a certain percentage of contaminants are hard to access and hence recalcitrant to any transformative activity. In soil where contamination has taken place for years, the aging phenomenon suggested by several workers can be responsible for the hindering or recalcitrant effects of the contaminant, but in laboratory-contaminated soil or lands where pollution occurs within few months, this aging phenomenon is very unlikely. Another possibility is that the earthworms did not have sufficient time and sufficient additional feeding, hence it may be that with sufficient additional resources and longer experiments, more complete biotransformation may occur.

The ability for this species of earthworms to biodegrade contaminant is not known but it is clear from our study that biodegradation and bioaccumulation are processes that are simultaneously taking place in the earthworms. It is also possible that earthworms can tolerate some concentration of contaminant without affecting its regular biological function and it only breakdown contaminant when it is exceeding its tolerance threshold. There is need for further research to shed light on this. In earthworms-contaminated soil, grasses started growing in the media after 20 days while in the control grasses appeared after 41 days.

Conclusion
Developing an effective strategy for the removal of petrochemicals from contaminated environment is one of the major challenges facing developing countries including Nigeria in her quest for economic development. This research has shown that the earthworm H. africanus has the potentials to bioaccumulate and biodegrade hydrocarbons from crude oil-polluted soil. The addition of additives or nutrients for the earthworms will increase and enhance the bioremediation process. These findings suggest that the earthworm could be applied in the later stages of bioremediation, even in highly contaminated soil with crude oil when the toxicity of the contaminant may have decreased or pre-treated to a tolerable level. Earthworm bioremediation does not only remove the contaminant but also enrich the soil by the addition of vermicast after reworking of the contaminated soil in the gut of the earthworm.

The strain grew optimally at 45 °C (growth range between 24 and 50 °C) and pH 7 (growth pH range between pH 5 and 9) in Luria Broth supplemented with 0.3 % glucose. Strain D7XPN1 tolerated up to 7 % NaCl and showed amylolytic and xylanolytic activities. 16S rRNA gene analysis placed strain D7XPN1 in the cluster represented by Bacillus subtilis and the genome analysis of the 4.1 Mb genome sequence determined using RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) indicated a total of 5116 genomic features were present of which 2320 features could be grouped into several subsystem categories. Of these, 615 features were related to carbohydrate metabolism which included a range of enzymes with potential in the biodegradation of food wastes, a property consistent with the ecological habitat of the isolate. ANIb (Average Nucleotide Identity based on BLAST) analysis with 49 Bacillus subtilis genomes indicated that it was distantly related to the three currently taxonomically validated B. subtilis subspecies namely B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (95.6 %), B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii (93 %) and B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum (92 %) and based on our current knowledge warranted that it be included as a separate cluster together with strain JS which it was closely related (98.69 %). The close relationship of strains D7XPN1 and JS is also supported from our results from electronic DNA–DNA Hybridization (e-DDH) studies. Furthermore, our additional in-depth phylogenomic analyses using three different datasets unequivocally supported the creation of a fourth B. subtilis subspecies to include strains D7XPN1 and JS for which we propose strain D7XPN1T (=KCTC 33554T, JCM 30051T) as the type strain, and designate it as B. subtilis subsp. stecoris.

Introduction
The members of the genus Bacillus comprise the low G+C containing Gram-positive bacteria and belong to the family Bacillaceae, order Bacillales, class Bacilli, phylum Firmicutes, domain Bacteria. They grow in a diverse range of habitats and include species that grow at extreme temperatures, salinities and pH. The phenotypic traits and physiologies of members of the genus Bacillus are as dynamic and wide ranging as their habitats and include species that grow as heterotrophs, autotrophs, in the presence or absence of oxygen and yet others grow in the presence of alternate electron acceptors such as iron, arsenate (Kanso et al. 2002). The extreme metabolic diversity, their non-pathogenic nature and the ease of isolating, handling and maintainance has opened them to biotechnological exploitation and in particular for use in agriculture, e.g. crop protection (Gao et al. 2015; Hussein et al. 2015; Ji et al. 2008). 16S rRNA-based taxonomy is routinely used to build taxonomic relationship amongst members of the domain Bacteria but it is well established that this technique fails to resolve closely related Bacillus species in which evolutionary divergence is limited. Given the lack of discriminatory power of 16S rRNA genes, a polyphasic taxonomic approach which combines 16S rRNA sequence analysis with phenotypic traits and DNA–DNA homology has been recommended to improve resolution. Examples of such an approach include the members of the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group which currently comprises of 6 species (B. cereus, B. anthracis, B. thuringiensis, B. mycoides and B. psedomycoides and B. weihenstephanensis (Zwick et al. 2012) and the B. subtilis group which comprises of 3 species B. subtilis, B.
vallismortis and B. mojavensis (Roberts et al. 1994, 1996). However, the topology of polyphasic trees is not always robust and can differ from the 16S rRNA based trees and therefore delineating species and strain boundaries using a polyphasic approach can be confusing. With the advent of the high throughput cost effective Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, estimation of overall similarity of microbial genomes by Genome-to-Genome Distance Comparison (GGDC), Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and genome phylogeny are being considered not only for delineating closely related species but also for taxonomic assignment of new isolates (Maughan and Van der Auwera 2011; Yi et al. 2014). Here we describe the construction of a molecular phylogenetic framework for Bacillus subtilis using genome sequences and its application to strain D7XPN1, an isolate from Baku Baku King™, a commercial food-waste degrading bioreactor (Adelskov 2013; Adelskov and Patel 2014).

Materials and methods
Bioreactor operation and sample collection
Biodegradation of food-wastes was carried out using Baku Baku King™ (model: M.I.G.0100), a food waste bioreactor. The biodegradation process was started in the bioreactor (day 0) by mixing 50 kg of municipal food waste sourced from a local hotel (Novotel Hotel, Gold Coast) with 200 kg of methyl bromide treated Japanese Larch wood chips and a microbial starter seed culture. The starter microbial seed culture was prepared by mixing 10 kg of leaf litter (collected from the Forest reserve located at Griffith University Nathan campus, Brisbane, Australia), with nutrients (sugar, honey, milk, meat, fish) followed by incubation for one week at room temperature (25–30 °C) before inoculation into the bioreactor. The bioreactor was subsequently fed 50 kg of municipal food waste per day sourced from the same hotel over a 49 day period. Samples (approximately 500 g) were collected from the bioreactor every 7–10 days of its normal operation cycle of 49 days including day 0 (the day of inoculation of the bioreactor with a starter seed culture). In total, seven samples were collected (days 0, 1, 7, 17, 21, 29 and 49). The temperature and aeration in the bioreactor was controlled by the inbuilt bioreactor’s electronic system.

Enrichment, isolation and phylogeny
1 g of bioreactor samples was resuspended in 10 ml sterile dH2O the solution shaken for 2 min and the debris allowed to settled for 5 min. 200 µl of settled suspension was spread on dTSA agar medium [dTSA consisted of 0.1 % (w/v) Tryptic Soy Broth, 1.5 % (w/v) bacteriological agar, pH 7.2]. The temperature of the bioreactor during most of the operation period was between 40 and 45 °C and hence the plates were incubated at 45 °C until colonies developed. Single well-isolated colonies that appeared morphologically distinct were picked and resuspended in sterile dH2O and a loopful streaked onto dTSA agar plates and incubated at 45 °C until colonies developed. This procedure was repeated several times before the isolates were considered to be pure. 28 pure cultures (Table 1) were obtained using this process and were stored at 4 °C and −20 °C. All isolates were routinely cultured using 0.1 % (w/v) (dilute) Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB), pH 7.2.Table 1 List of strains isolated from the waste-food degrading bioreactor, Baku Baku™

aThe strains were isolated on 0.1 % (dilute) Tryptic Soy Agar (dTSA) medium and colony morphology noted after 48 h incubation at 45 °C


bXylanase and amylase activities were determined as described in “Materials methods” Section


cThe closest phylogenetic match was determined by BLAST analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences of the isolates against the NCBI 16S ribosomal RNA (Bacteria and Archaea) database




The 28 isolates were cultured in TSB (pH 7.0) at 45 °C for 18 h, the cells centrifuged and the DNA from the pelleted cells purified using a modification of Marmur’s method as described by Ogg and Patel (2009). In brief, bacterial cells were resuspended in a buffered solution (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.8) and treated with 0.8 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.3 mg/ml Achromopeptidase and 0.1 mg/ml RNAse A and subsequently lysed by adding 0.12 mg/ml Proteinase K and 6 mg/ml sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to the suspension. The DNA from the lysate was purified using phenol:chloroform extraction. Purified DNA quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and DNA concentration determined fluorometrically using a Qubit™ dsDNA HS assay kit as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, USA). The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from the DNA of the isolate by PCR using the universal forward primer Fd1 (AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and reverse primer Rd1 (AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC) that bind to the 8–27 and 1512–1493 base pair positions of E. coli numbering scheme according to Winkler and Woese (1991). Reactions of 50 µl volume consisted of: 0.2 mMdNTP, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Fd1, 1 mM Rd1, 0.5–5 ng of DNA template, 2.5 U of Taq polymerase (Mango Taq) and provided reaction buffer. PCR proceeded using a Corbett Research FTS-1 Thermal sequencer with the following cycle program: cycle 1; 2 min 95 °C; 1 min 50 °C; 2 min 70 °C, cycle 2–32; 55 s 94 °C, 1 min 50 °C, 2 min 72 °C. The reaction amplicon was purified by either SureClean™ or Gel extraction (QIAGEN) following manufacturer’s instructions. The purified amplicons were sequenced on an ABI 3730xl 96-capillary sequencer using Fd1 and Rd1 primers at AGRF (Australian Genetics Research Facility). 16S rRNA gene sequence manipulation and phylogenetic analysis was performed as described previously (Redburn and Patel 1994).

All isolates were screened for the presence of amylase activity by inoculating a loopful of culture onto dTSA agar medium supplemented with 1 % soluble potato starch (Chem Supply, Australia) and incubation at 45 °C until colonies developed. The plates were flooded with Gram’s Iodine solution and a positive reaction for amylase production recorded for isolates when there was a zone of clearance around colonies against a red–purple background. Isolates were screened for xylanase activity by streaking X-xyl Agar plates followed by incubation at 45 °C. X-xyl Agar plates contained (g−L distilled water): Tryptic Soy Broth (Oxoid, USA) 1 g, xylan from birchwood (Sigma, USA) 3 g, Bacteriological Agar (Oxoid, USA) 15 g, X-β-D-xyloside (Gold Biotech, USA) 0.2 g, pH 7.2 and incubated at 45 °C. Xylanase production was recorded as positive when colonies showed a blue color.

One of the isolates designated D7XPN1, which produced a xylanase and amylase, was selected for further studies and is described in more detail in this paper.

Characterization of strain D7XPN1
Temperature, pH and salinity growth studies were conducted in 18 mm glass culture tubes containing 15 ml of modified Luria Bertoni Broth (mLBB). mLBB contained per litre Luria Bertoni Broth (Oxoid, USA) 25 g, d-Glucose anhydrous (Lab Supply, Australia) 3 g. For temperature studies, mLLB was inoculated with 0.2 ml of an overnight culture and incubated in water baths maintained at 37, 45, 50, 60, 70 °C and incubated for 48 h. For pH studies, the pH of mLBB was changed to the desired pH (pH range of 4.0–10) by addition of 1 M HCl or 1 M NaOH, inoculated with 0.2 ml of an overnight culture and incubated in water baths maintained at 45 °C. For salinity studies, appropriate amounts of NaCl was weighed and added to mLBB medium to achieve the desired concentration of salinity (3–7 %), inoculated with 0.2 ml of an overnight culture and incubated in a water bath maintained at 45 °C for 48 h. Following incubation, growth was determined by inserting the glass culture tubes directly into a modified cuvette holder of a Novaspec LKB spectrophotometer and the absorbance measured at 600 nm. Anaerobic growth was tested in Trypticase, Yeast Extract, Glucose (TYEG) medium as described previously (Ogg and Patel 2009).

Dataset and genome sequencing
Unless indicated otherwise, all computational analysis was performed using a 16 CPU Dell workstation with 64 gigabytes RAM and an Intel® Xeon(R) CPU X5570 @ 2.93 GHz × 8 chipset running Ubuntu 12.04 and the Australian Government Information Technology Infrastructure Facilities accessed under the National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR) program.

Complete and draft Whole Genome Sequences (WGS) for all strains that were identified in GenBank microbial genome database as Bacillus subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens and B. atrophaeus were downloaded from the NCBI ftp server ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/bacteria (release 204) (Table 2). Unless indicated otherwise, sequence contigs from all GenBank files were extracted and converted to fasta format (Vesth et al. 2013) and any plasmid sequences accompanying the genome data (B. subtilis subsp. natto str. BEST195, B. subtilis subsp. str. NCIB 3610 and B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str. B7-s) were removed before use in comparative genomic studies.Table 2

Library construction and sequencing of the genome of strain D7XPN1 was performed at the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF) core facility on an Ion Torrent PGM sequencer using a 318 chip. The sequencing data was converted to FASTQ format and adapters were removed from individual reads. The quality of the sequencing data was assessed using PRINSEQ (http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/) (Schmieder and Edwards 2011). Genomic contigs were assembled from reads using the GS de novo Assembler (Newbler) software (http://454.com/products/analysis-software/index.asp). The assembled draft genome was annotated using Prokka, version 1.10 (Seemann 2014) and the RAST automated annotation pipeline server (http://rast.nmpdr.org/) (Aziz et al. 2008), which employs subsystems technology to identify genes related to different categories of cellular processes and metabolism (Overbeek et al. 2014). The whole-genome shotgun project of Bacillus subtilis strain D7XPN1 (= KCTC 33554, JCM 30051) has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession number JHCA00000000. The version described in this paper is version JHCA00000000.1.

Estimation of overall genome relatedness indices (OGRI) for strain D7XPN1
OGRI methods depend on comparisons of whole genome rather than single genes or a set of genes and ANIb has been established as a method of choice. ANIb was performed with genome nucleotide sequences using the calculate_ani.py script (https://github.com/widdowquinn/scripts) that incorporates the ANI algorithm by Richter and Rossello-Mora (2009). In addition, intergenomic e-DDH distances were calculated using Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC) with the recommended formula as described by Meier-Kolthoff et al. (2013).

Phylogenomics
The use of groups of orthologous proteins or a set of common conserved genes across genomes is required for phylogenomic analysis and several methods are available for such studies. In our study, we first used Prokka (version 1.10) (Seemann 2014) to identify open reading frames (ORF) of genome nucleotide sequences (n = 43), which were subsequently translated into putative protein sequences and annotated. We then created two protein datasets for phylogenomic studies. For the first, we used the hal pipeline with default settings to find and extract all protein orthologs (Robbertse et al. 2011) and for the second, we used CD-Hit (Huang et al. 2010) to select for a smaller but highly conserved set of orthologuous proteins from the annotations (>97 % AA identity). Additionally, we used the 6 conserved MLST gene dataset (glpF, pta, purH, pycA, rpoD and tpiA) typically used for typing strains of Bacillus subtilis for phylogenomic Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA). The 6 genes were downloaded from pubMLST database and used in local BLAST queries against the Bacillus subtilis genome database of open reading frames (ORF) and the MLST genes retrieved. The datasets of the conserved protein sequences from hal and CD-Hit and the MLST nucleotide sequences were aligned separately using CLUSTALW (http://www.clustal.org/clustal2) (Larkin et al. 2007), concatenated into a single super-alignment and used to construct Maximum Likelihood trees using PhyML (Guindon et al. 2010).

Results
Strain isolation and phylogenetic identification
28 strains were isolated from bioreactor samples collected over 49 days of operation. The strains were selected on the basis of differences in colony morphology, growth rates and enzyme screening (amylase and xylanase) (Table 1). 16S rRNA gene (sequence length between 560 and 1555 bp) analysis revealed that 27 of the 28 isolates were members of the genera Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Kurthia and Aneurinibacillus, phylum Firmicutes, domain Bacteria (Fig. 1) whereas
the 28th isolate, identified using 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis (sequence length 1738 bp) analysis as Ogataea polymorpha, a yeast (data not shown). Further phylogenetic analysis showed that 9 of the isolates cultured from samples taken from the bioreactor on days 0, 1, 7, 17, 21, 29, and 49 of its operation cycle (Table 1), and which included strain D7XPN1, were closely related to Bacillus subtilis (99 % similarity) (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Phylogenetic distance tree constructed from partial 16S rRNA sequences (467 nucleotides) of bacterial strains isolated from samples retrieved from Baku Baku™ a food waste bioreactor.

Phenotypic characterization of strain D7XPN1
The cells of strain D7XPN1 were short rods which stained Gram positive and produced cream coloured, opaque, raised, irregular-shaped colonies on dTSA medium. Strain D7XPN1 grew optimally at 45 °C (growth temperature between 24 and 50 °C) suggesting that it was a thermotolerant/moderate thermophile and pH 7 (pH growth range between pH 5 and pH 9). The strain tolerated up to 7 % NaCl (the highest tested) and grew anaerobically by fermentation in the absence of oxygen.

Genome studies of strain D7XPN1
A total 722,222 reads with a mean read length of 196.13 bp (total of 141,651,194 bp) were produced using IonTorrent™. The assembly of these reads with GS assembler (Newbler) produced 28 genomic contigs (average coverage of 40x) with contig sizes ranging from 1,017,528 to 510 bp in length and a N50 of 504,008 bp. RAST server identified a total of 5116 genomic features that included 69 RNA and 5047 protein coding sequences (Fig. 2). Of the 5047 total features, 2,320 were placed into functional subsystems. Two subsystems categories related to carbohydrates and amino acid and derivatives had the highest number of associated features with 615 and 506 coding features, respectively.Fig. 2

Estimation of overall genome relatedness indices (OGRI)
49 strains which had a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of ≥97 % to B. subtilis strain 168, together with genomes of the members of B. subtilis sensu lato group, B. atrophaeus and strain D7XPN1 were initially used in the ANIb studies (Table 2). The study showed that 43 strains with an ANIb similarity values >92 % could be regarded as members of B. subtilis (Fig. 3) whereas the remaining 6 strains 
whose similarity values were <92 %, should be examined more closely. Closer examinations showed that B. subtilis strain GBO3, B. subtilis strain SPZ1 and B. subtilis str. NKYL29 shared a high ANIb similarity value (97 %) with B. amyloliquefaciens and B. subtilis subsp. niger str. PCI with B. atrophaeus (99.9 %) (Table 3). Additionally, review of the literature showed that the genome of B. subtilis strain BEST7613 was a chimeric construct of the genomes of Synechocystis strain PCC6803 and B. subtilis 168 (Watanabe et al. 2012) and the examination of the statistics of the genome of B. subtilis B7-S showed that it had a genome that was substantially different in size (5.3 Mb) and in G+C mol % content (35.1) to 43 members of the B. subtilis cluster. These 6 misclassified strains were therefore removed from further analysis.Fig. 3 ANIb heatmap of Bacillus subtilis genome sequences (n = 43). Individual genome-to-genome ANIb values are represented in the central bi-color gradient heatmap, the color key shown on the top left had side including adivison line for the recommended subspecies cutoff value (97 %). The heatmap is accompanied by a hierarchical clustering dendrogram with for distinct clades (clusters): B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (A, green), B. subtilis subsp. stecoris (B, pink), B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii (C, yellow) and B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum (D, blue). Refer to Table 2 for the type strains in this figure

The remaining 43 strains could be further grouped into 4 clusters based on ANIb similarity values (Fig. 3). Cluster 1 constituted the largest group (33 strains) with a ANIb similarity value of >98 % amongst the members and is represented by the taxonomically validated B. subtilis subsp. subtilis. Of the 33 strains, 16 have already been identified as members of cluster 1. Cluster 2 consists of the two newly isolated strains JS (Song et al. 2012) and D7XPNI (Adelskov and Patel 2014), (Fig. 2) which have an ANIb similarity value of 95.6 % to cluster 1 and to each other by 98.8 %. These two strains have not been taxonomically validated previously and in this report we propose to describe these two strains as members of a new subspecies, B. subtilis subsp stecori of which strain D7XPN1T is the type sub-species. Cluster 3 is composed of two strains of the taxonomically validated B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum (Table 1) with an ANIb similarity value of 92 and 93 % to clusters 1 and 2, respectively and to each other by 98.6 %. The remaining 6 strains belong to a loose cluster represented by the taxonomically validated B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii which have an ANIb similarity value of between 92 and 94 % with members of clusters 1, 2 and 3. Of the 6 strains, 4 strains have been correctly identified as members of this cluster (Table 2). Of the 6 strains, 4 strains (B. subtilis str. BSC154, B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii str. W23, B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii str. ATCC 6633 and B. subtilis str. BST) group closely together (ANIb value of >99 %) whereas B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str. DV1-B-1 and B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii str. TU-B-10 are more distant (ANIb values of 95.6 and 92.2 %, respectively) to the 4 strains.

DNA homology using genome-to-genome-distance-calculator (GGDC)
DNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) method is a gold standard that is used to differentiate species of the same genus when the 16S rRNA sequence similarity is >97 %. The widely accepted species boundary set by the DDH method is 70 %. The Genome-to-Genome-Distance-Calculator (GGDC) is an in silico alternate for the traditional experimental DDH method and is the second OGRI method used in our study. As all the B. subtilis strains (n = 43) have a 16S rRNA similarity value >97 %, we have calculated the GGDC similarity indices of representatives genomes from each of the 4 sub-species clusters. The results show that B. subtilis subsp. stecori strains D7XPN1 and JS of cluster 2 share a genome similarity of 88.6 % to each other and 62.2–62.9 % with strains of cluster 1 represented by B. subtilis subsp. subtilis and <51 % with strains from the clusters 3 and 4 represented by B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii and B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum (Fig. 4).

Phylogenomic analysis
Phylogenomic trees produced from the analysis of 1724 core protein sequence orthologs (436,410 aa) and the more conserved 534 protein sequence orthologs generated from CD-Hit analysis (≥97 % amino acids similarity) are presented in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively and the Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) tree generated from the 6 genes routinely used in Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) of B. subtilis strains is shown in Fig. 7. All 3 trees resolve Bacillus strains (n = 43) into 4 clusters with the same topology and with 100 % bootstrap values at each branch point of the clusters and the phylogenomic studies supports the results from genome to genome comparisons studies of ANIb and DDH (Fig. 3) though there are slight changes in the topology of the internal branches of cluster 1 representing B. subtilis subsp. subtilis.

Discussion
It is well-established that 16S rRNA phylogeny does not readily separate closely related strains of Bacillus
subtilis and including differentiating phenotypic characteristics to phylogenetic data does not necessarily assist in taxonomic delineation. For example, dark pigmented colonies are a distinctive feature of B. atrophaeus but some strains of B. subtilis also produce such colonies (Nakamura 1989). Several recent studies have discussed the need to establish microbial taxonomy on the basis of information retrieved from microbial genomes especially when 16S rRNA similarity values are >97 % and many computational methods, which can be categorised into two broad groups, have been reported in the literature (Bull et al. 2012; Larsen et al. 2014). Computational methods which rely purely on comparison of nucleotide sequences of genomes, have been recently coined by Chun and Rainey (2014) as Overall Genome Relatedness Indices (OGRI) methods and include ANI, GGDC, GBDP (Genome Blast Distance Phylogeny), Maximal Unique Matches Index (MUMi) whereas methods which rely on comparison of conserved genomic features (e.g. core genes and proteins) where sequence disparities are the result of evolutionary pressures, are known as phylogenomic methods.

In this study we isolated 28 strains from a food-waste degrading commercial bioreactor of which 9 isolates could only be assigned as strains of B. subtilis based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis (Fig. 1). We selected strain D7XPN1 as representative of the 9 isolates, sequenced and using OGRI (ANIb and DDH) and phylogenomic methods compared it’s genome with genomes of B. subtilis and B. subtilis-like strains that had been retrieved from NCBI database. For this we initially downloaded 49 B.
subtilis genomes but were left with only 43 after identifying and removing mixed or misclassified genomes. Of these remaining genomes of 43 B. subtilis strains, 21 strains had already been used by Yi et al. (2014) in their studies and our results support their conclusions that ANIb can be used to separate B. subtilis into 3 subspecies. They had further suggested that if the threshold ANIb value of 95–96 % were to be used for species delineation than B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii and B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum should be designated as new species. ANIb analysis of the additional 22 strains which were not part of the studies of Yi et al. (2014) revealed that 20 could be assigned to one of the 3 clusters defined by Yi et al. (2014) but a further 2 strains, strains JS and D7XPN1, were closely related to each other (ANib value of 98.8 %) and formed a separate cluster, designated cluster 2. Cluster 2 was a sister branch of cluster 1 and was more closely related to it than to clusters 3 and 4 (ANIb values of 95.6, 93 and 92–94 %, respectively).

Based on the conservative cut off DDH value of 70 %, B. subtilis strains (n = 43) can be assigned to 4 clusters, each represented by a subspecies and is consistent with the findings of the ANIb analysis. The results also confirm that strains D7XPN1 and JS are related more closely to each other than to members of cluster 1 represented by B. subtilis subsp. subtilis and supports results from the ANIb analysis. In addition, all the 3 phylogenomic trees generated using 3 different data sets (1724, 534, and 6 core orthologs) resolve Bacillus strains (n = 43) into 4 clusters with the same topology and with 100 % bootstrap values at each branch point of the clusters and the phylogenomic studies supports the results from genome to genome comparisons studies of ANIb and DDH studies though there are slight changes in the topology of the internal branches of cluster 1 representing B. subtilis subsp. subtilis.

Phylogenomic studies indicate that there are differences in the gene and protein content of the 43 strains. Doolittle and Zhaxybayeva (2009) have hypothesised that the acquisition of genes can affect changes in an ecological niche and that even the closest relatives could be ecologically distinct ecotypes. Kopac et al. (2014) in their studies on B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii (cluster 4), which has 6 members, 4 of which were isolated from Death Valley, showed that all the genomes of the four Death Valley strains differed in gene content supporting the hypothesis of Doolittle and Zhaxybayeva (2009) that even the closest relatives could be ecologically distinct ecotypes. However, Kopac et al. (2014) were unable to demonstrate if the acquisition of genes could in fact change the metabolic dynamism of the ecological niche.

It would be interesting to extend the studies to B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (cluster 1) the most widely represented strains in B. subtilis but for the fact that the strains have been isolated from a very wide range of environments and therefore any differences found in the gene content could be considered to be biased due to habitat differences. We have in our study reported here 9 strains of B. subtilis isolated from samples taken from the bioreactor on days 0, 1, 7, 17, 21, 29, and 49 of its operation cycle (Table 1), all of which are closely related (16S rRNA similarity >99 % similarity). Strain D7XPN1 reported in our studies, was isolated from a sample collected on day 7 and is a representative of the nine B. subtilis strains. Strain D7XPN1 is capable of growing at moderate thermophilic temperatures and contains an array of enzymes for degradation of polysaccharides including a xylanase and an amylase. We intend to sequence and compare the genomes of all the 9 strains and if the hypothesis of Doolittle and Zhaxybayeva (2009) holds true then we should be able to see differences in the gene profiles which would potentially be reflective of the change in environmental conditions in the waste-degrading bioreactor, from day 0 to day 49.

The genome of strain JS isolated from the soil of a pot planted with Miscanthus sp. was sequenced and a number of genes associated with plant growth promoting and antifungal activities were identified (Song et al. 2012). In addition, the use of volatile extracts of strain JS were found to reduce the disease in bacterial infected tobacco plants (Kim et al. 2015). Our analysis of the annotations of the genome of strain D7XPN1 has also identified potential plant growth-promoting genes similar to those found in strain JS. The properties of strain D7XPN1 has potential for use as an inoculum source to improve and increase efficiency of the food-waste degradation process at thermophiic temperatures but additionally, it also has the potential for use as a plant growth promoting fertilizer at the completion of the degradation process.

Strains JS and D7XPN1 have not yet been taxonomically validated but based on the OGRI and phylogenomic results reported here, we propose to describe these two strains as members of a newly created subspecies that we designate B. subtilis subsp stecori of which strain D7XPN1T is the type sub-species. Furthermore, we propose that once more strains of clusters 2, 3 and 4 have been isolated and their genome sequences analysed than if necessary, the reassignment of the B. subtilis strains should be reconsidered given the low ANIb (≤95–96 %) and DDH values (<70 %) which demarcate each of the fourclusters.

VLD-10 using the conventional and genomic (16S rRNA) approaches. Bioactive compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity of the strain were elucidated by cultivating the strain VLD-10 in a modified yeast extract-malt extract-lactose broth followed by subsequent chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses. Extraction, purification, and structural confirmation of five compounds, viz., benzoic acid, 2-nitrobenzaldehyde, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, nonadeconoic acid, and 3-isopropylhexahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a] pyrazine-1,4(6H)-dione, from Rhodococcus sp. VLD-10 were fruitfully described. The bioactivity of the compounds isolated from the strain VLD-10 against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria, yeast, and molds was tested and their minimum inhibition concentration was reported. Antibacterial activity of 3-isopropylhexahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a] pyrazine-1,4(6H)-dione is more prominent against Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Escherichia coli, whereas its antifungal spectrum showed less potency against yeast and fungi. This is the first report on the natural occurrence and bioactivity of 3-isopropylhexahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a] pyrazine-1,4(6H)-dione from Rhodococcus sp. VLD-10.

Introduction
Microorganisms are capable of carrying out a tremendous variety of reactions and can adapt to a range of environments allowing them to be transplanted from nature to the laboratory where they can be grown on inexpensive carbon and nitrogen sources to produce valuable compounds (Narayana and Vijayalakshmi 2008; Manivasagan et al. 2013). Because of their biological activity, secondary metabolites of microbial origin are extremely important to our health and nutrition, and have a tremendous economic importance. The screening of microbial natural products continues to represent an important route to the discovery of novel chemicals, for development of new therapeutic agents and for evaluation of the potential of lesser-known or new bacterial taxa (Kurtboke and Wildman 1998; Ramesh and William 2012). Natural products or their derivatives remain the most significant source of novel medicines (Newman et al. 2003; Fenical 2006; Lam 2007; Manivasagan et al. 2013). Among the potential sources of natural products, bacteria are proven to be a predominantly prolific resource with a surprisingly small group of taxa accounting for the vast majority of compounds discovered (Keller and Zengler 2004). Among them, bacteria belonging to the order Actinomycetales (commonly called actinobacteria) are distributed ubiquitous in nature and account for more than 50% of the compounds reported in the Dictionary of Natural Products.

In world’s 70% water ecosystem, Indian marine environment is believed to have rich microbial diversity. However, the wealth of indigenous marine microflora has not been fully explored. Most of the studies on marine microorganisms have been limited to isolation, identification, and maintenance of these organisms on different culture media. Their biotechnological potentials are yet to be fully explored (Sivakumar et al. 2007; Manivasagan et al. 2013). East Coast of India is reported to be a major source of actinobacteria (Sambamurthy and Ellaiah 1974; Balagurunathan 1992; Dhanasekaran et al. 2005; Vijayakumar et al. 2007). Therefore, there is tremendous scope to identify new or rare marine microorganisms from this region and also to discover novel microbial metabolites with diverse biological activities (Dhanasekaran et al. 2005; Ramesh and Mathivanan 2009; Ramesh and William 2012). The recent discovery of novel secondary metabolites from taxonomically unique populations of marine actinobacteria suggested that these bacteria add an important new dimension to microbial natural product research. Continued efforts to characterize marine actinobacterial diversity and how adaptations to the marine environment affect secondary metabolite production will create a better understanding of the potential utility of these bacteria as a source of useful products for biotechnology (Jensen et al. 2015). These findings will hopefully encourage additional studies addressing the ecological roles of actinobacteria in the marine environment, their diversity, distribution, culture requirements, and evolutionary responses to life in the sea. In view of the significance of marine actinobacteria as potential producers of bioactive compounds, this study is mainly aimed to identify the potent strain, Rhodococcus sp. VLD-10, isolated from marine soil samples of Bheemili beach, Visakhapatnam, India, and to characterize the bioactive metabolites responsible for its antimicrobial activity.

Materials and methods
Isolation and identification of an actinobacterial strain VLD-10
An actinobacterial strain, VLD-10, was isolated from marine samples collected at a depth of 5–10 cm from Bheemunipatnam beach, Visakhapatnam, India, in sterile polyethylene bags. The soil dried at 45 °C for 1 h in hot air oven was pretreated with calcium carbonate (1:1 w/w) followed by plating on YMD agar medium using soil dilution technique (Williams and Cross 1971).

Taxonomic studies of the actinobacterial strain VLD 10
Cultural, physiological, and morphological characteristics together with genomic (16S rDNA gene sequencing) analysis of the strain were studied.

The growth characteristics of the strain were studied on seven International Streptomyces Project (ISP) media, such as ISP-1 (Tryptone-yeast extract agar), ISP-2 (Yeast extract-malt extract-dextrose agar), ISP-3 (Oat meal agar), ISP-4 (Inorganic salts starch agar), ISP-5 (Glycerol-asparagine salts agar), ISP-6 (Peptone yeast extract iron agar medium), and ISP-7 (Tyrosine agar), as well as on five nonISP media, such as Nutrient agar (NA), Czapek–Dox (CD) agar, Bennett’s agar, Glucose–tryptone (GT) agar, and Starch casein (SC) agar, with the initial pH 7.2 maintained at 30 °C (Dietz and Theyer 1980). Cultural characters, such as growth, color of the aerial and substrate mycelia, and pigment production, were observed. Physiological and biochemical tests of the strain were examined using standard protocols (Shirling and Gottlieb 1966).

Slide culture technique was employed to study the micro-morphology of the strain cultured on ISP-2 medium. The detailed micro-morphology of the strain was recorded using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) as previously described (Bozzola and Russell 1999). The culture was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h at 4 °C followed by the post-fixation step in 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide for 4 h in the same buffer. The sample was then dehydrated in ethanol and then dried up to critical with the help of Electron Microscopy Science CPD unit (Ruska Labs, Acharya N. G. Ranga Agricultural University, Hyderabad, India). The dried sample was mounted on aluminum stubs covered with double-sided carbon tape. A thin layer of gold coating was applied over the sample using automated sputter coaster for 3 min (JEOL JFC-1600, Japan). Finally, the samples were examined under SEM at various magnifications (Model: JOEL-JSM 5600, Japan).

Molecular identification of the strain based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis
The strain grown in YMD broth for 3 days was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min and the pellet was used for the extraction of DNA (Mehling et al. 1995). PCR mixture consisted of 2.5 μl of 10X Taq buffer, 3.5 μl of MgCl2 (25 mM), 2 μl of dNTP (0.4 mM), 1 μl of 16S rDNA forward primer—5′-CCCATG TTGGGTATTCCTCCAGGCGAAAACGGG 3′ (10 pmol/μl), 1 μl of 16S rDNA reverse primer—5′CCCGCATTATCCGTACTCCCCAGGCGGGGC-3′ (10 pmol/μl), Taq polymerase (2 U/μl), and 2 μl template DNA. PCR amplification was carried out as follows: the initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 65 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with a further 5 min extension at 72 °C. The PCR product was purified with agarose gel DNA purification kit (SoluteReady® Genomic DNA purification kit, HELINI Biomolecules, Chennai, India) followed by sequencing of 750 bp. The deduced partial 16S rDNA gene sequence was compared with the accessible sequences in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) in NCBI GenBank databases. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA) version 4.0 (Tamura et al. 2007).

Extraction, purification, and structural confirmation of bioactive compounds produced by Rhodococcus sp. VLD-10
Production of bioactive metabolites
For the large-scale production of bioactive compounds from the strain, 10% of seed broth was inoculated into the optimized production medium (lactose @ 10 g, yeast extract @ 10 g, malt extract @ 10 g, and sodium chloride @ 60 g dissolved in 1 L distilled water and adjusted to pH 7.0) for the enhanced secondary metabolite production. The fermentation was carried out in 1 L Roux bottles for 120 h at 30 °C.

Isolation, purification, and identification of bioactive compounds
The bioactive compounds from the fermented broth were harvested by filtration of biomass through Whatman filter paper no. 42 (Merck, Mumbai, India). The culture filtrate (25 L) was extracted twice with an equal volume of ethyl acetate and pooled, and the organic layer was concentrated in a Rotovac. The deep brown semi-solid compound (3.8 g) obtained was applied to a silica gel G column (80 × 2.5 cm, Silica gel, Merck, Mumbai, India).

The separation of the crude extract was conducted via gradient elution with hexane: ethyl acetate. The eluent was run over the column and small volumes of eluent collected in test tubes were analyzed via thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel plates (Silica gel, Merck, Mumbai, India) with hexane: ethyl acetate solvent system. Compounds with identical retention factors (R
f) were combined and assayed for antimicrobial activities. The crude eluent was recuperated in 5–10 ml of ethyl acetate and was further purified.

Among the 11 main fractions eluted, 10 fractions were found polar and 1 was nonpolar residue. Antimicrobial activity was tested for all the fractions obtained. Among the 10 polar fractions eluted from the crude extract, three fractions along with the nonpolar fraction exhibited high antimicrobial activity. D1 (70–30 v/v), D2 (30–70 v/v), D3 (20–80 v/v), and D4 (100–0 v/v) were the fractions collected at different hexane: ethyl acetate solvent system. All the fractions were rechromatographed using different gradient eluent systems for final elucidation of compounds. The fraction D1 on further purification yielded two compounds each in pure form (D1Ba and D1Bb). The second fraction D2 also yielded two subfractions in pure form namely D2Ba and D2Bb. The fraction D3 was single and obtained in pure form. The structure of these active fractions was analyzed on the basis of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR); model: Thermo Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrophotometer with NaCl optics, Electron Ionization Mass/Electron Spray Ionization Mass Spectrophotometry (EIMS/ESIMS); model: Micromass VG-7070H, 70 eV spectrophotometer and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR and 13C NMR); and model: Varian Gemini 200, and samples were made in CDCl3 with trimethyl silane as standard.

Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of bioactive compounds
The antimicrobial spectra of the bioactive compounds produced by the strain were determined in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against a wide variety of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi using agar plate diffusion assay (Cappuccino and Sherman 2002). Nutrient agar and Czapek–Dox agar were the media prepared for the growth of bacteria and fungi, respectively. The metabolite dissolved in DMSO at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 μg/ml was used to assay against the test bacteria, such as B. cereus (MTCC 430), B. megaterium (NCIM 2187), B. subtilis (MTCC 441), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (MTCC 116), E. coli (MTCC 40), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 424), Salmonella typhi (ATCC 14028), Serratia marcescens (MTCC 118), Shigella flexneri (MTCC 1457), Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 96), Xanthomonas campestris (NCIM 2310), and fungi, including Aspergillus niger (ATCC 1015), Alternaria alternata (MTCC 6572), Botrytis cinerea, C. albicans (MTCC 183), Fusarium oxysporum (MTCC 218), F. solani (MTCC 4634), and Verticillium alboatrum. The inoculated plates were examined after 24–48 h of incubation at 37 °C for bacteria and 48–72 h at 28 °C for fungi. The lowest concentration of the bioactive metabolite exhibiting significant antimicrobial activity against the test microbes was taken as the MIC of the compound.

Results and discussion
Isolation and identification of an actinobacterial strain VLD-10
An actinobacterial strain, VLD-10, isolated from marine samples of Bheemunipatnam beach, Visakhapatnam, India, was purified on YMD agar medium using classical microbiological methods. Taxonomic position of the strain was described on the basis of cultural, morphological, physiological, and genomic analyses.

Cultural characteristics of the strain were studied by growing the isolate on seven ISP media and five nonISP media and the results are tabulated in Table 1. It exhibited good growth on ISP 2, ISP 4, ISP 6, Bennett’s Agar, and SC Agar, while it was moderate on ISP 1, ISP 3, ISP 5, NAM, CD, and GT agar media. Growth was found to be less on ISP 7. No pigment production was observed in any of the media. Color of aerial and substrate mycelium ranged from dark brown to light brown. Aerial mycelium was white on NAM and CD agar media. Micromorphological studies of the strain through slide culture technique and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed the formation of short rods by the fragmentation of hyphae in their growth phase (Fig. 1).Table 1 Cultural characteristics of the strain VLD10

According to Kampfer et al. (1991), physiological tests play a significant role in the classification and identification of actinobacteria. The strain exhibited good growth with glucose, lactose, starch, and sucrose as carbon sources, while it was moderate with maltose and fructose compared to arabinose, d-galactose, glycerol, mannitol, raffinose, and xylose. It exhibited good growth with organic nitrogen sources like yeast extract and tryptone followed by peptone and l-asparagine. Inorganic nitrogen sources like sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, and ammonium nitrate did not support the growth. The isolate was indole and methyl red positive. It showed negative results for Voges Proskauer and citrate utilization tests (Table 2). The comparison of biochemical and morphological characteristics of the strain with those reported in Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (Buchannar and Gibbons 1974) revealed its identity as Rhodococcus sp.Table 2 Physiological and biochemical characteristics of the strain VLD 10

The strain exhibited good growth in the medium amended with 7–8% (w/v) NaCl, while growth was moderate between 1 and 6% (w/v). No growth was found in the medium without NaCl indicating its halophilic nature. It could produce a broad range of commercially important enzymes like amylase, cellulase, chitinase, l-asparaginase, protease, and pectinase, but it was negative for DNase, RNase, keratinase, and nitrate reductase. It was found to be sensitive to antibiotics, such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, neomycin, penicillin, rifampicin, and tetracycline, but showed resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin, and vancomycin (Table 2).

Using 16S rRNA analysis, the gene sequence of the strain was compared and aligned with those sequences retrieved from NCBI GenBank database using the BLAST analysis. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by neighbour-joining method using the MEGA software (Fig. 2) and deposited in the Gene Bank with an accession number KC505180. Based on these cultural, morphological, physiological, and molecular analyses, the strain VLD-10 was identified as Rhodococcus sp. VLD-10 belonging to the family Corynebacteriaceae.Fig. 2 Phylogenetic tree of 16SrRNA sequence of the actinobacterial strain VLD 10 constructed in comparison with those of species of genus Rhodococcus using neighbour-joining method.

Isolation and purification of bioactive compounds from crude extract
For the isolation and purification of bioactive compounds, crude extract was applied on a silica gel G column (80 × 2.5 cm, Silica gel, Merck, Mumbai, India) and their separation was conducted via gradient elution with hexane: ethyl acetate. Elutions were collected sequentially in small test tubes and those fractions having similar retention factors (R
f) on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) silica gel plates were pooled together. Out of 11 eluted main fractions, 10 are polar residues and 1 is nonpolar residue. Among the ten polar fractions, three fractions and the single nonpolar fraction exhibited high antimicrobial activity. These four fractions, namely D1, D2, D3, and D4, were collected at different eluent systems of hexane: ethyl acetate solvent systems, viz., 70–30 v/v, 30–70 v/v, 20–80 v/v, and 100–0 v/v, respectively. All the fractions were rechromatographed using different gradient eluent systems to obtain the fractions in pure form for structural elucidation. The flowchart showing the isolation and purification of bioactive fractions is illustrated in Fig S1.

(Fig. S6h). Based on these spectral data, the active fraction D3 was identified as 3-isobutylhexahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione This is the first report from actinobacteria.

Determination of MIC of the isolated bioactive compounds
MIC of the bioactive compounds, viz., benzoic acid, 2-nitrobenzaldehyde, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, nonadeconoic acid, and 3-isopropylhexahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a] pyrazine-1,4(6H)-dione (Fig. 3), along with crude extract of the strain VLD-10 against bacteria and fungi was determined. The sensitivity of bacteria as well as fungi to the compounds exhibited variation and the MIC of these compounds ranged from 5–100 µg/ml (Table 3). Bioactive compounds of the crude extract showed good antimicrobial activity against test bacteria and fungi in the range of 10–20 µg/ml. Benzoic acid (D1Ba) is active against bacteria, such as B. cereus, S. aureus, and X. campestris as compared to the other bacteria tested, while Botrytis cinerea is sensitive among fungi. 2-nitrobenzal dehyde (D1Bb) is mostly active against bacteria like B. subtilis, Shigella flexneri, and Staphylococcus aureus. 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (D2Ba) is active against S. aureus, B. subtilis, and S. flexneri. Nonadeconoic acid (D2Bb) is active against S. flexneri, S. aureus, B. subtilis, and X. campestris. Among all the compounds, 3-isopropylhexahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a] pyrazine-1,4(6H)-dione (D3) is more active against B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, C. diphtheriae, and E. coli, but it showed less activity against the fungi when compared to that of standard control (nystatin). The partially purified fraction (D4) exhibited good activity against Bacillus spp. tested.Table 3 Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the bioactive compounds produced by Rhodococcus sp. VLD10

Rhodococci are notable for the ability to degrade a variety of natural and xenobiotic compounds (Bell et al. 1998) along with few bioactive metabolite reports. Chiba et al. (1999) purified and elucidated a novel antifungal cyclic tetrapeptide, Rhodopeptins (Mer-N1033) from Rhodococcus sp. Two antimycobacterial agents, lariatins A and B, were elucidated by Iwatsuki et al. (2006) from the culture broth of Rhodococcus sp. K01-B0171 using spectral analysis and advanced protein chemical methods. Kitagawa and Tamura (2008) isolated a new quinoline antibiotic, aurachin RE from the culture broth of Rhodococcus erythropolis JCM 6824 active against both high- and low-GC Gram-positive bacteria.

Isolation and purification of rhodostreptomycin A and B by a combination of cation exchange (CM-Sephadex) and reversed-phase HPLC (Lichrospher 60RP-select B) from the culture broths of Rhodococcus fascians 307CO were recorded (Kurosawa et al. 2008). Abdel-Meged et al. (2011) purified, characterized, and tested the antimicrobial activity of glycolipids produced by Rhodococcus erythropolis isolated from soils of Riyadh area, Saudi Arabia. Borisova (2011) found that antimicrobial compound (MW 911.5452 Da) of Rhodococcus opacus isolated from the soils of East Tennessee State University inhibited R. erythropolis and a large number of closely related species.

This study has revealed the production of five bioactive compounds, such as benzoic acid, 2-nitrobenzaldehyde, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, nonadeconoic acid, and 3-isopropylhexahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a] pyrazine-1,4(6H)-dione, from Rhodococcus sp. VLD-10. Benzoic acid is a well-known food preservative that inhibits the growth of bacteria, yeasts, and molds (Warth 1991), which is also evident from our findings in vitro. The bioactive compounds, 2-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-chlorobenzaldehyde play a prominent role in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, dyes, agrochemicals, and other organic compounds. However, their natural occurrence from Rhodococcus spp. and their biological significance is not yet reported. This is the first report of 3-isopropylhexahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a] pyrazine-1,4(6H)-dione isolated from Rhodococcus sp. VLD-10.

It has been seen that the factors such as temperature and pH influence the biodegradation process. The role of plasmid was studied in the degradation process by plasmid curing method. The PCZ acts as the sole carbon source and as energy substrate which can be utilized by the strain for its growth in Mineral salt medium and degraded 8.89 µg ml−1 of PCZ at 30 °C and pH 7 within 4 days. During the bioconversion process of PCZ, three metabolite were formed such as 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) ethanone, 1-[2-(4-chlorophenyl) ethyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole and 1-ethyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole. The LD50 value of BBK_9 strain was determined with acridine orange which resulted in 40 µg ml−1 at cell density of 0.243 at 660 nm. Furthermore, plasmid curing was done using LD50 concentration and from that three plasmids got cured in the sixth generation. It was found that, cured strain was able to degrade 7.37 µg ml−1 of PCZ, indicating the plasmid encoded gene were not responsible for the PCZ degradation. On the source of these outcomes, strain BBK_9 can be used as potential strain for bioremediation of contaminated sites.

Introduction
The economy of India is largely depend on the agricultural production, due to the implementation of advanced technologies in the form of bio fertilizers, chemical fertilizers and different forms of pesticides have made possible to increase the quality and quantity of field products (Ramudu et al. 2011). Moreover, attention on the pesticides has increased during the recent times due to their versatile nature and various modes of action. Currently, triazole fungicides are the extensively used among the all fungicides for the protection of standing crops against plant pathogens. Whereas, the toxicity and non-target effect of azole fungicides are vastly under represented.

Propiconazole (PCZ) is a triazole foliar fungicide, which is used in the agriculture. The yearly intake of this fungicide is about 7373 g a.i. ha−1. The degradation of pesticides by microorganisms is gaining the extensive attention in the agricultural field and environmental microbiology. Interestingly, only few literatures are there which are dealing with the fungicide degradation by bacteria and in the previous years, many experiments have suggested that bacterial community are effective degraders of many different classes of fungicides: vinclozolin (Lee et al. 2008), tubeconazole (Nicole et al. 2009), captan (Megadi et al. 2010), benzimidazole (Cycon et al. 2011) and thiram (Sherif et al. 2011) and is necessary since PCZ biodegradation was not thoroughly investigated with the exception of Sarkar et al. (2009). Moreover, previously available reports are mentioned that PCZ utilization by microorganisms is not possible because of its ability to strongly adsorb with the soil’s organic matter (Kloskowski et al. 1987; Ekler 1988; Woo et al. 2010). Similarly, laboratory scale degradation has been conducted in the different soils using commercial grade of PCZ alone or the mixture with benazone, dichlorprop and 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid. It was revealed that the highest persistence of PCZ was found in agricultural soil since its traces were seen even after 84 days duration of experiment. (Thorstensen and Lode 2001). As per the technical information bulletin for PCZ, the half life ranges from low 96 days in a sandy loam to 575 days in a silt loam. Similarly, PCZ degradation by photolytic method in water is as long as 249 days. Thus, there is need of effective and cost friendly techniques which can degrade the PCZ from contaminant sites.

The isolate grown in respective medium is necessary to produce important metabolites which are precursors of degradation and it is also important to know that, potent microorganisms are likely to yield important new information on how the isolated bacteria is capable of degrading the toxic pesticide that prevails in the agricultural soil. Therefore, this study was under taken to isolate the potent microorganism which will prove their capability to metabolize PCZ under the liquid medium in given optimal conditions. Also, the function of plasmid and ability of cured strain in degrading the PCZ was investigated.

Materials and methods
Chemicals and reagents
Propiconazole was obtained from Nagarjuna Agrichem Co., Ltd (Srikakulam, India), ethyl acetate and acetonitrile of HPLC grade were purchased from the HiMedia and all other chemicals, and reagents were used for this experimental study are highest analytical grade.

Soil samples and media
For this study, soil was collected from the uppermost layer (0–10 cm) of paddy field with the pesticide application situated in the Koppal district of Karnataka, India. The mineral salt media (MSM) (Seubert 1990) was used for this study.

Isolation of PCZ utilizing bacteria
The samples of soil which were collected from the different places were aseptically brought to the laboratory, 1 g of sieved soil was added in 100 ml of MSM and the flasks were placed in the incubator shaker at 30 °C in 100 rpm for 1 h. Further, 10 ml of soil suspension was inoculated to 100 ml of sterile MSM broth containing 1 µg ml−1 of PCZ as the only carbon source and energy substrate, incubation of all the flasks was done for 7 days at 30 °C in 120 rpm. After the incubation period the serial dilution of media was done up to 10−7 and appropriate dilutions (10−5, 10−6) were inoculated in nutrient agar (NA) medium containing PCZ (1 µg ml−1) and all the colonies that were appeared on the NA were purified by quadrant streak method and stored at 4 °C.

Screening and acclimatization
Several different colonies were isolated, all colonies that were appeared on the NA were examined for their PCZ utilizing capacity depending upon the colony count on mineral salt agar medium (MSAM) in different concentration of PCZ (2 and 10 µg/L). Further, highly potent strain was acclimatized for the better development and utilization of PCZ degrading bacterium.

Identification of PCZ utilizing bacteria
The potent PCZ utilizing soil isolate was identified as per the morphological, Gram’s characteristics and biochemical tests. Further, 16S rRNA sequencing was done at Xcelris genomics, Ahmedabad, India. Isolation of bacterial genomic DNA was done using xcelgen genomic DNA isolation kit and bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragment was amplified by PCR (Eppendorf Thermal Cycler) from genomic DNA using 16S gene universal primers: 8F and 1492R. Further, amplified PCR product was purified using xcelgen gel extraction kit. After determination of purified DNA, sequencing was done using automated DNA sequencing on ABI 3730xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). Sequencing was done using Big Dye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle. Further, to perform the pairwise/multiple sequence alignment, the CLUSTALW tool was used and phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using bootstrap test (1200 replicates) (Saitou and Nei 1987), the evolutionary distance was computed using the MEGA 7 package by Tamura and Nei (1993) method and sequence of organism was deposited in the gene bank with the accession number LC099979.

Utilization of PCZ by Burkholderia sp. BBK_9 strain
Propiconazole resistant strain was pre cultured in nutrient broth at 30 °C in rotary shaker, and 3 × 106 cell ml−1 from the same media was inoculated in 100 ml of liquid MSM containing 10 µg ml−1 of PCZ which acts as sole carbon source and growth substrate, then incubated at 30 °C in rotary shaker with 120 rpm. The cultures were periodically collected and measured the OD at 600 nm for cell growth, and bacterial suspension of all samples was centrifuged at 10,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. Further, culture filtrates were extracted with the ethyl acetate in rotor flash evaporator (Buchirotavapor R 210) and the residues were dissolved in the acetonitrile (HPLC grade) to examine the utilization of PCZ by UV spectrophotometer (Hitachi U 2900) at 220 nm. All the tests were performed in three replicates. Percentage of PCZ degradation was calculated by formula which was previously mentioned by the Rokade and Mali (2014). %of propiconazole degradation=Ab-Aa/Ab×100 where, Ab is initial percentage of PCZ in MSM (before degradation) and Aa is percentage of PCZ after 4 days.

Extraction of metabolites by preparative HPLC
The extraction and purification of metabolites was done by the preparative HPLC on an Agilent Zorbax SB-C18 preparative column (250 × 9.4, 5 µm). For the preparation of the three fractions, chromatographic peaks were collected at the exit of the detector into three different pools. Subsequently, the compounds or the pools were concentrated by removing/evaporating the solvent.

Biodegradation analysis
To quantify the degradation rate of PCZ by BBK_9 strain, the HPLC method was followed with little modification and was described by Bromilow et al. (1999). Briefly, 20 µl of test sample was injected into HPLC Agilent 1260 fitted with quaternary pump, auto sampler and variable wavelength UV detector with C 18 column (diameter 150 × 4.6 mm) having particle size 5 micron and elution of samples were done at 1.5 min ml−1 with the mobile phase methanol + water (70:30). Mass spectrum (MS) was used for the analysis of metabolites (Shimadzu). One microliter of each sample was examined at MS by conditions: the transfer line temperature was 240 °C, with 230 °C ion trap and 120 °C manifold temperature. Full-scan (60–550 m/z) EI (auto mode) with 10 mA filament current was used for MS analysis from 5–31 min, which gave 2.7 scans/s. Target automatic gain control was 15,000, and the multiplier voltage was 1450 V. The mass scan range at 1000 in the electron ionization mode (EI).

Effect of temperature and pH on biodegradation of PCZ
The optimal condition required for degrading PCZ was tested in MSM amended with the PCZ (10 μg ml−1), the pH tolerance of the isolate necessary for degrading PCZ was examined at pH values of among 5.0–9.0 and pH of MSM was adjusted using the 1N NaOH and 1N HCL. Similarly, optimum temperature conditions were studied ranging between 20 and 60 °C. The degradation percentage was monitored by the UV spectrophotometer (Hitachi U 2900) at 220 nm. All trials were performed in three replicates and in flasks which were not inoculated served as control.

LD 50 value determination and plasmid curing of isolate BBK_9
LD 50 value determination
The bacterial isolate BBK_9 was grown in nutrient broth for 18 h and inoculated (0.1 ml) into nutrient broth tubes (5 ml) with different concentrations of acridine orange (5–50 µg ml−1). Control tube without acridine orange was also maintained. The culture was grown for 24 h at 37 °C and the biomass was measured at 660 nm. The OD values of treated samples were compared with that of control and LD50 concentration was determined.

Plasmid curing
Plasmid curing of isolate BBK_9 strain was determined by the LD50 concentration was used to treat the bacterial isolate for five to six generations. The inoculation of test organism was done in 25 ml of nutrient broth which was autoclaved and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Five tubes of nutrient broth containing LD50 concentrations of acridine orange were prepared and 18 h old test organism was inoculated (1 %) in tube no. 1. The control tubes without acridine orange were also prepared and inoculated, as mentioned earlier, the incubation was done at 37 °C for 24 h. 1 % culture from tube no. 1 was inoculated to tube no. 2 and incubated further for 24 h. This serial inoculation was continued till plasmid curing was attained. The presence/absence of plasmid was observed by running it on 1 % agarose gel by isolating the plasmid at every generation. Meanwhile, the plasmid cured BBK_9 strain was examined for its capability for degrading PCZ.

Statistical analyses
All Experiments were carried in a three independent replicates. Analysis of data was done by one way ANOVA variance SPSS version 20.0 software and data were denoted as means ± standard errors. The difference among the each means were located using Duncan’s test (P < 0.05).

Results
Isolation, screening and characterization of PCZ utilizing bacteria
Total of 11 strains (BBK_1-11) were isolated from the paddy cultivated soil. Quadrant streak method was utilized for purifying all strains on nutrient agar plates containing PCZ (1 µg ml−1). Further, strains were screened for their ability to utilize PCZ in different concentrations (2–10 µg ml−1). As a result, BBK_9 strain was found most promising candidate for the utilizing of PCZ with a substantial growth in the all concentration. For the better enhancement of degradation process BBK_9 strain was acclimatized in MSM amended with PCZ (10 µg ml−1).

Identification of BBK_9 strain
The BBK_9 strain was found Gram negative, non-motile, aerobic, rod shape. Biochemically it was found catalase and urease positive. The blast analysis of 16S rRNA sequence of isolate BBK_9 strain reveals closer resemblance with the Burkholderia sp. A45 strain (Genebank accession number KF788025). The phylogenetic tree shows the evidence for identifying the isolate which is represented in Fig. 1. The phylogenetic tree of BBK_9 was constructed with those of the soil isolates, with 78–100 % homology to those of species that are known to be potent degraders of pesticides and heavy metals.Fig. 1 Phylogenetic tree analysis of PCZ degrading strain, constructed through neighbor-joining method with bootstrap values as percentage at the nodes




Utilization of PCZ by Burkholderia sp. BBK_9 strain
The bacterium Burkholderia sp. BBK_9 strain was tested for its PCZ degrading capability and the biodegradation was achieved up to 8.89 µg ml−1 (88.87 %) after the incubation of 4 days. Bacterial growth and degradation was measured at 600 and 220 nm, respectively. In the meantime, no abiotic loss was observed in the control flasks and its proof is given in the Fig. 2.Fig. 2 Time course degradation of PCZ.

Error bars represents mean ± standard error (SE) of three replicates




Effect of temperature and pH on PCZ degradation
It was evident that, the upper and lower temperatures are responsible to affect the degradation rate of PCZ. The maximum degradation was achieved at optimum condition 30 °C with degradation up to 89.31 %. However, the degradation rate was decreased up to 47.73 % at 20 °C and 10.55 % at 60 °C (Fig. 3a). Likewise, the degradation rate of PCZ also gets affected by higher and lower pH values, pH 7 (90.31 %) was found optimum condition and least degradation was obtained at pH 3 (11.19 %) and pH 11 (13.94 %) (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3

Biodegradation analysis
The standard PCZ was eluted at the retention time 6.8 min (Fig. 4a) with single peak and also in D0 (before inoculation of bacterial suspension) and mass of PCZ was determined by the mass spectra at m/z 342.22. However, culture filtrate extracted on the first, second, third and fourth days showed the considerable decrease in the PCZ peak with the formation of other metabolite peaks, which confirms degradation of PCZ. It is necessary to consider that, the culture filtrates extracted in different days showed the two important stable metabolites (M1 and M2) having retention time of 0.9 and 1.3 min, respectively, and also other metabolites were mineralized during entire degradation process. Further during fourth day at 4.3 min other compound (M3) was detected (Fig. 4b). Metabolites were extracted by preparative HPLC and identified by fragmentation pattern and m/z values such as 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl) ethanone (m/z 256) (M1), 1-[2-(4-chlorophenyl) ethyl]-1H-1,2,4-triazole (m/z 207) (M2) and 1-ethyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole (m/z 98), respectively. The structural confirmations of all metabolite were assigned from the fragmentation and m/z values procured. The proposed pathway for the PCZ degradation is showed in Fig. 5.Fig. 4

LD50 value determination and plasmid curing of isolate BBK_9
LD50 value was determined by amending the acridine orange in media inoculated with BBK_9 strain. LD50 value of BBK_9 strain was observed to be 40 µg ml−1 at cell density of 0.243 at 660 nm, which is 0.443 half the density of the control. The plasmid curing of BBK_9 strain was performed by LD50 concentration up to sixth generation, the presence or absence of plasmid at every generation was analyzed by isolating it. It was found that, the three plasmids were present at approximately 23.13, 9.14 and 4.36 kb, respectively, plasmids were hampered after the second generation. It indicates that, the curing process has taken place and the complete plasmid curing was observed at sixth generation (Fig. 6). Furthermore, plasmid cured strain was examined for its PCZ degradation capacity, which showed that, the substantial growth of plasmid cured organism in MSM was attained with degradation of PCZ up to 7.37 µg ml−1 at the initial concentration of 10 µg ml−1(Fig. 7).Fig. 6 The effect of curing agent acridine orange on BBK_9 strain; lane1 Marker, lane2 control, lane 3 and 4 showing the presence of plasmids in the first and second generation, lane 5, 6 and 7 plasmid curing with hampered plasmid at the third, fourth and fifth generation, lane 8 complete curing of plasmid at sixth generation

Discussion
In this study, we have isolated most impending candidate for degrading the PCZ from the fungicide contaminated paddy soil. It was evident that, the population of Burkholderia sp. was observed to be predominant in the paddy soil and the bacterium Burkholderia sp. BBK_9 strain was evidenced for its ability to utilize PCZ as sole carbon and growth substrate in liquid medium resulting 8.89 µg ml−1 (88.87 %) of degradation under the optimal conditions pH 7 and 30 °C. The preparative HPLC method came across as the most useful method for extracting and identifying the metabolites. Furthermore, culture filtrate yielded three precursors of PCZ degradation namely, 1-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-1, 2, 4-triazol-1-yl) ethanone (M1), 1-[2-(4-chlorophenyl) ethyl]-1H-1, 2, 4-triazole (M2) and 1-ethyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole (M3). Based on the fragmentation pattern M1 was identified with degradation of dioxolane ring from the PCZ representing the degradation product with molecular weight of 256. Simultaneously, M2 resulted from the loss of PCZ dioxolane ring and elimination one chlorine atom from the PCZ with molecular weight of 207. Metabolite M3 is identified by the loss of 1-chloro-4-methylbenzene with m/z value of 98. This experimental study would throw the light on plasmid role in the degradation. Moreover, plasmid cured strain was also an able contender in degrading the PCZ and it was clear that plasmid encoded genes does not play any role in the degradation process.

Isolation of pesticide resistance bacteria from the contaminated soil is the initial stage to understand the microbial population and to evaluate their tolerant capacity to the particular environment. Previously, Goda et al. (2010) isolated the five malathion degrading bacteria from Egyptian soil, among the all isolates Pseudomonas putida strains were chosen to conduct the degradation study due to their high efficacy and the important of this strain is revealed by repeated enrichment isolation method. The another research from united kingdom reveals the potential of isolation and screening of perithroid degrading bacteria which is isolated from the soil and in this study the potent bacterial strains were screened based on colony morphology which is having largest size (Grant et al. 2002). Paracoccus sp. strain TRP was able degrader of chlorpyrifos (CP) and 3,5,6-trichloro-pyridinol (TCP) and it was the supreme candidate for the degradation of both the compounds in higher concentration than the other isolated strains and the screening of all strains were evaluated by CP and TCP utilizing capacity (Xu et al. 2008). This suggesting the screening for the potent strain in the biodegradation study is most important parameter.

In general, Burkholoderia is a genus of proteobacteria which is having impressive applications in the field of agricultural, as a potent agent in the process of biodegradation, biocontrol, and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (Estrada-de Los Santos et al. 2013) and also reported for its potentiality for degrading pesticides (Hong et al. 2007; Kim and Ahn 2008; Pimmata et al. 2013). Degradation of many pesticides by microorganisms under the in vitro conditions is mainly temperature and pH dependent. In support to this study, Kim et al. (2002) have given the evidence that temperature will be the major key to degradation of PCZ. Standardization of optimized parameters has significant influence over any biodegradation process and also reported that acidic and alkaline conditions were not suitable for degradation experiments due to their ability in limiting the growth of bacteria (Phugare et al. 2012). Recently, Talwar et al. (2014) has reported the studies on optimized conditions in degrading the quinalphos. Interestingly, PCZ degradation is assisted by UV in the presence of titanium dioxide (TiO2) as a catalyst in aqueous solution under optimum conditions like pH (6.5), intensity of light (30 Wm−2) and constant temperature (25 ± 1 °C) during the period of experiment (Kaur et al. 2015). The physical parameters (pH and temperature) will have greater influence on the degradation of PCZ.

A limited information is available for microbial degradation of PCZ, in support to our current study, Sarkar et al. (2009) suggesting, P. putida is the most effective candidate for the utilization of PCZ under the liquid medium and also carbon source like glucose will enhance the process of degradation. Although, none of the PCZ metabolites were not reported. More importantly, metabolic pathway of PCZ by Burkholderia sp. BBK_9 is reported for the first of its kind. The white rots, brown rots and moulds were investigated by wood matrix method for their degradation capacity of carbon based preservatives, and it was achieved up to 75 % of degradation applied at 1.39 kg m−3 (Woo et al. 2010). Above mentioned two literatures suggests that carbon sources will be the major key factor in degrading PCZ under different method of degradation process. It indicates that influence of energy source will have the impact on degradation mechanism.

Correspondingly, Kim et al. (2002) studied the fate of PCZ in paddy soil lysimeter and possible metabolites. Namely, 1-[[2(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1,2,4-triazole-1-yl) ketone (DP1), 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1,2,4-triazole-1-yl) ethanol (DP2) and 1[[2(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypropyl-1,3-dioxolane-2-yl]methyl]1H-1,2,4triazole. Further, carbon dioxide and bound residue were found to be metabolites of the PCZ. The metabolite DP2 was found similar in our investigation, this supports the present experimental results. Importantly, the dioxolane ring degradation from the PCZ is the initial step in degradation process. Vialaton et al. (2001) studied the photolysis of PCZ in pure water, in water containing humic substances and in natural water, it was revealed that PCZ was photo degraded and the dissolution of PCZ was found 25 % faster in natural water then the pure water. Similarly, the fate of PCZ degradation in canal water was tested under the laboratory conditions; which showed the dissipation of PCZ up to 80 % (Chauhan et al. 2008). Worryingly, the triazole fungicides are used more than the other group of fungicides but the studies regarding microbial degradation have been vastly under represented. Additionally, PCZ is major triazole agent, it is known to be highly persistent in soil and it will prevent the microorganisms from existing in the soil with long term effect (Yen et al. 2009). Importantly, the fungicides were never classified and characterized according to their mode of action, it indicates the problems for the assessing the non-target effect. Conversely, for the protection of biological functions and soil fertility, selection of fungicides is very important to prevent the non-target effects (Yang et al. 2011).

Previously, five triazole fungicides were investigated for their degradation ability in peaches field by photo degradation method. Expect PCZ, residual levels of cyproconazole, penconazole, tebuconazole and hexaconazole were found higher the recommended limits at preharvest time. Further, it is also reported that PCZ is highly stable and it will decrease in concentration during the plant growth by diluting effect, it indicates that PCZ is the stable among the other triazoles (Angioni et al. 2003). Additionally, triazole fungicides are globally used for the commercial purpose and most of them are known to be persistent in soil for longer duration and the studies over field have suggests that traces of triazoles will have impact on the soil fertility along with crop yielding (Bromilow et al. 1999). Triazole fungicide often shares a same mode of actions (Li et al. 2013; Satapute and Kaliwal 2015). Hence, Burkholderia sp. BBK_9 strain may also be useful in degrading the other triazole pesticides.

Plasmid cured strain was well distinguished for gaining of the resistance over PCZ in current study; it indicates that chromosomal genes are directly responsible for degrading the PCZ by BBK_9 strain. However, only few bacteria were isolated which carry an extra chromosomal DNA. The plasmid cured Pseudomonas aeruginosa MCMB-427 strain was found unable in degrading the dimethoate in liquid media. Suggesting, plasmid (designated as pDMD427) has direct involvement in the degradation (Deshpande et al. 2001). Interestingly, other plasmid cured Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain which is heavy metal resistant strain found potent candidate to utilize cadmium, chromium and lead indicating that it contains chromosomal genes in degradation mechanism (Raja and Selvam 2009). In case of degradation of fenitrothion, Burkholderia sp. strain NF100 is the supreme agent and it was investigated that degradation was encoded by the involvement of plasmids designated as pNF1 and pNF2 (Hayatsu et al. 2000). The slow rate of imidacloprid degradation was found by plasmid cured Brevundimonas sp. MJ15 strain. Interestingly, the degradation was archived up to 50 % lesser than the uncured strain. Suggesting, both chromosomal and extra chromosomal genes may involve in degradation process of imidacloprid (Shetti and Kaliwal 2012). Whereas, plasmid of Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains the plasmid encoded genes which take part in the degradation mechanism of methomyl (Kulkarni and Kaliwal 2014). Thus, the use of Burkholderia sp. BBK_9 strain for biodegradation of hazardous chemicals to make toxic-free environment is possible.

Conclusion
In this experimental study, the isolation of a potent Burkholderia sp. strain BBK_9 was done from paddy soil and also its ability to utilize PCZ was assessed. The isolate was able to transform PCZ into three important metabolites. These experimental results suggested that isolate degraded PCZ up to 8.89 µg ml−1 (89 %). Along with that the strain preserved its ability to utilize PCZ at 30 °C and pH 7. Plasmid cured cells were also a healthy competitor which can degrade the PCZ. Indicating additional studies to advance more widen view over PCZ degrading enzymes and gene from Burkholderia sp. BBK_9 strain. Thus, results of this study showed that the Burkholderia sp. strain BBK_9 can play a role as significant biological candidate for cleaning up of the contaminated pollutants.

The present communication explores the potential of 22 endophytic Botryosphaeria species isolated from stem of Aegle marmelos for their fibrinolytic potential. Only nine fungal isolates exhibited proteolytic activity out of which only four possessed plasminogen-independent fibrinolytic activity. The endophytic fungal isolate #1088 AMSTITYEL showed maximum in vitro proteolytic and fibrinolytic activity with a halo formation of 153.86 and 113.04 mm2, respectively. The partially purified protein exhibited a fibrinolytic activity equivalent to 6.51 U/ml of plasmin. SDS–PAGE of the dialysed fraction of #1088 AMSTITYEL resolved into six bands ranging from 26 to 80 kDa. Fibrin zymogram exhibited that a single band of molecular size ~80 KDa possessing the fibrinolytic activity. Furthermore, the bioactive isolate #1088 AMSTITYEL was identified as Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae using classical and molecular taxonomic tools.

Introduction
Blood clots are formed as a preventive response of the human body to avoid excessive bleeding at the site of injuries and wounds (Raafat et al. 2012). Fibrin is the major protein involved in blood clot formation, which is formed from its precursor fibrinogen by the enzymatic action of thrombin (EC 3.2.21.5) and is further lysed by plasmin (EC 3.4.21.7) (Kim et al. 1996). Under normal condition, blood clot formation and its dissolution are meticulously regulated by the biological system; however, impairment in this doctrine mechanism leads to thrombosis where the insoluble blood clots do not get hydrolysed and adhere to the wall of the blood vessels ultimately resulting in cardiovascular disorders (CVDs), such as myocardial infarction, high blood pressure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and so on (Simkhada et al. 2010). These CVDs toll over 18 million lives annually and are expected to rise to 23.6 million by 2030 (Mander et al. 2011). The current armamentarium of drugs involved in thrombolytic therapy involves intravenous administration of streptokinase and urokinase, which instantly opens up the blood flow caused due to fibrin blockage, thus reducing the chances of morbidity and mortality (Raafat et al. 2012; Kim et al. 1996). Based on their mechanism of action, thrombolytic drugs are divided in two types: the former is plasminogen activators and urokinase, which converts dormant plasminogen into active plasmin that hydrolyses the fibrin clot and the latter one is plasmin-like proteins that directly hydrolyse the blood clots (Simkhada et al. 2010). Despite their widespread use, these drugs suffer certain shortcomings, such as low specificity to fibrin, internal bleeding, short half-life and cost effectiveness (Wu et al. 2009b). Therefore, there has been a continual search for safer and cost-effective fibrinolytic agent from diverse sources. To date, fibrinolytic agents have been isolated and characterised from different sources, including plants, animals, microbes and fermented foods (Deng et al. 2010; Choi et al. 2011). Microbes are considers as a lucrative source of fibrinolytic agents due to their diverse biochemical nature, feasibility of mass culture and ease in genetic manipulation. Hence, over the last two decades, fibrinolytic enzymes have been successfully discovered from microbial sources, such as bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi (Peng et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2009b; Mander et al. 2011).

Endophytic fungi are special group of microorganisms residing within the plants, which play an important role in defending the host plant against stresses, such as pathogenic invasions and drought. The genetic recombination of the endophytes with the host plant enables them to mimic the biological properties of their host and produce analogous bioactive metabolites. Production of an anticancer compound ‘taxol’ in the culture broth of Taxomyces andrenae isolated from Taxus baccata is the best example of it (Daisy and Strobel 2003; Zhang et al. 2006). Exploration of enzymatic properties of these endophytic fungi is a novel and largely under-explored aspect, and there exist scanty literature on screening and isolation of novel fibrinolytic enzymes from these microorganisms. Endophytic fungi, such as Verticillum sp., Fusarium sp. and Bionectria sp., are amongst few reported to possess in vitro fibrinolytic activity (Li et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2009a; Rovati et al. 2010).

In this study, we undertook an in vitro screening program to assess the fibrinolytic potential of 22 endophytic fungal isolates of Botryosphaeria species isolated from the Western Ghats in India. This study is also the very first report of an endophytic Botryrosphaeria species exhibiting fibrinolytic activity. Fungal fibrinolytic enzymes may be exploited as a substitute to streptokinase, which is of bacterial origin and currently being exploited as a thrombolytic agent by the pharmaceutical Industry.

Materials and methods
Plant sample collection and isolation of the endophytic fungi
Healthy twigs of medicinal plant Aegle marmelos (Bael, golden apple) belonging to family Rutaceae were collected from the conserved rain forest area of Western Ghats, geographically located between 11°59′ and 11°99′N, 77°8′ and 77°14′E (Yelandur, BRT wildlife sanctuary, Karnataka) and 11°35′–11°51′N, 76°14 02′–76°27′E (Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary, Wayanad, Kerala) during rainy season of 2009. The endophytes from the twigs were isolated by previously described method (Schulz et al. 1993). Briefly, the twigs (5 cm) were surface sterilized with sequential washing with 2 % sodium hypochlorite for 3–5 min followed by 70 % ethanol for 2 min and then with 30 % ethanol for 1 min. The surface sterilized samples were then cut into 1-to-2-mm segments with the help of sterile blade and placed over water agar plates under aseptic conditions. These were then incubated at 26 °C for 10 days. The efficiency of surface sterilization was confirmed by imprinting the surface sterilised plant part over the PDA plate. The absence of fungal growth on the respective medium portion confirmed the efficacy of surface sterilization. Maximum of eight segments was inoculated each plate. The fungus emerging out of the host tissue was aseptically subcultured to fresh PDA plate, so as to obtain pure isolates. These pure isolates were further preserved on PDA slants supplemented with 10 % glycerol (Naik et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2010). The colonisation frequency (% CF) of endophytic fungi was calculated using the formula % CF = (N
col/N
t) × 100, where, N
col = number of segments colonised by each fungus and N
t = total number of segments inoculated (Gond et al. 2007). Isolation was performed in duplicate for samples collected from each location. The endophytic fungal isolates were encoded based on the host plant, its part and the place from where it was collected, e.g. #6 AMSTYEL, where #6 refers to segment number; AM stands for Aegle marmelos; ST refers to stem, YEL signifies to Yelandur, Karnataka (sample collection site). Furthermore, #6 AMSTYEL belong to the first phase of isolation, whereas #1088 AMSTITYEL denotes to the second phase of isolation (10 refers to the second set of isolation, whereas 88 refers to the segment number). Similarly, #20 AMSTWLS refers to 20th segment from stem tissue of Aegle marmelos collected from Wayanad, Kerala.

Preparation of cell-free culture filtrates
Liquid cultures of 22 endophytic fungal isolates were produced to assess the extracellular in vitro fibrinolytic activity. Briefly, the method comprised of an aseptic inoculation of 50-ml presterilised Czapek Dox Broth (HiMedia, India) with 5-mm mycelial disc of 7-day old culture of the endophytic fungus followed by incubation at 26 ± 1 °C, 130 rpm for 7 days. After completion of the incubation period, the mycelial mass was separated using Whatmann filter paper, followed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm (Hitachi CF 15 RX II series, Japan) for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was then passed through 0.22-µm nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, USA). These cell-free culture filtrates were further tested for their in vitro proteolytic and fibrinolytic potential by plate assays (Ali and Ibrahim 2008).

In vitro proteolytic and fibrinolytic assays
The cell-free culture filtrates were tested for their proteolytic and fibrinolytic activity by plate assays (Ali and Ibrahim 2008). The production of a proteolytic and fibrinolytic enzyme was indicated by formation of a halo around the well where the test sample was dispensed.

In vitro proteolytic activity
Briefly, in vitro proteolytic activity was performed on agar plates comprising of 1 % skimmed milk (HiMedia, India) dissolved in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer as substrate together with 1 % agar (w/v). After solidification, 5-mm wells were scooped, and 30 µl of cell-free culture filtrate was dispensed on agar plate and incubated at 37 °C for 18–24 h. No culture filtrate was added in the control well. After incubation period, proteolytic activity was evaluated by measuring halo diameters. For screening purposes, proteolytic activity was expressed as the clear zone area (in mm2) (Rovati et al. 2010).

In vitro fibrinolytic activity
Fibrinolytic activity was determined following a modified procedure described by Astrup and Mullertz on plasminogen rich and plasminogen free plates (Astrup and Mullertz 1952). Briefly, plasminogen free plates were prepared by mixing 5 ml of 0.5 % w/v fibrinogen (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) in 50-mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.8) with 1 % agarose and 100 µl of thrombin (100 NIH U/ml, Sigma Aldrich, USA). Plates were allowed to stand for 30 min at room temperature to form fibrin clot. Plasminogen rich plates were supplemented with 5 U of plasminogen (Sigma Aldrich, USA). Thereafter, 30 µl of the cell-free extract was dispensed into 5-mm wells. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The control wells were devoid of culture filtrate. Clear transparent zone suggested fibrin degradation, and the potency of fibrin degradation is proportional to its diameter. After measuring the dimension of the clear zone, the number of units was determined according against a calibration curve of plasmin (from human plasma, Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany, Supplementary material 1). Average diameter was computed by diagonally measuring the clear zone around the well (Rovati et al. 2010; Choi et al. 2013). All the tests were performed in triplicate, and their mean and SD was calculated.

Partial purification and characterisation
Based on the screening results, the endophytic isolate exhibiting highest fibrinolytic activity was selected for further studies. Solid ammonium sulphate (HiMedia, India) was slowly added to the culture broth (#1088 AMSTITYEL) to achieve 70 % saturation. The mixture was then incubated overnight at 4 °C, and the next day protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (Hitachi CF 15 RX II series, Japan) for 15 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was dissolved in minimum volume of 50-mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.8). The crude enzyme was further dialysed against the same buffer overnight, and the dialysed fraction was recovered after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C (Li et al. 2011). The fractions obtained after each step was tested for fibrinolytic activity via fibrin plate assay as described previously, while the protein content was determined by Bradford’s method using bovine serum albumin (HiMedia, India) as standard and measuring the absorbance at 595 nm (Bradford 1976).

The crude enzyme extract was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) (Laemmli 1970). The molecular mass of the denatured enzyme was estimated using a standard broad range protein weight marker (Merck, Millipore, USA). The resolved proteins were detected in the gel by modified silver staining method (Blum et al. 1987). Fibrin zymography was performed according to the method of Kim et al. (1998). Resolving gel solution (12 %) contained 0.12 % (w/v) fibrinogen prepared in a total volume of 10 ml and centrifuged to remove insoluble impurities which were induced when SDS stock solution was mixed. Thrombin solution (1 U/ml) and TEMED (N, N,
 N′, N′-tetramethylethylenediamine) were added to the gel solution in final concentrations of 0.1 U/ml and 0.028 % (v/v), respectively. The enzyme was electrophoresed on a fibrin gel. The gel was then washed in 2.5 % Triton X-100 solution, incubated in zymogram reaction buffer [30 mM Tris (pH 7.4)] containing 200-mM NaCl, 10-mM CaCl2, and 0.02 % NaN3 at 37 °C overnight, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (SRL, India) and, subsequently, destained. The cleared white area against the blue gel represents fibrin degradation.

Taxonomic studies
Taxonomic identification of the selected endophytic fungal isolate exhibiting highest fibrinolytic activity was done using morphotaxonomic and molecular taxonomy.

Molecular taxonomy
For genomic DNA extraction, about 0.1–0.2 g of cultured mycelia was scrapped off from 3-to-4-day old culture with sterile inoculation loop and crushed to very fine powder in pestle and mortar using liquid nitrogen. Furthermore, DNA extraction was done by using Wizard® Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega,USA) following manufacturer instructions. Furthermore, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region 1, 5.8S, 2 was amplified using ITS 1 and ITS 4 primers (White et al. 1990). A 25-µl reaction mixture consists of 1 µl of extracted genomic DNA, 10 µM of each primer, 2.5 mM of dNTP, 1.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase in 10 X Taq buffer containing 25-mM MgCl2 (GeNei, Bangalore, India). The thermal cycling conditions consisted of initial denaturation at 96 °C for 5 min followed by 39 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s followed by final extension at 72 °C for 5 min (White et al. 1990). The ITS amplicons were examined using a 1.5 % agarose gel under UV light in Bio-Rad Gel documentation system using Quantity-1-D analysis software. The PCR products were purified with Wizard® SV gel and PCR clean up system (Promega, USA) following manufacturer’s protocol. PCR products (500–600 bp) were sequenced from Chromus Biotech Labs (Bangalore, India). The final sequence was obtained by assembling the chromatograms using Sequencher ver. 5 (www.genecodes.com). The final sequence was submitted in GenBank under the accession number KJ 756377.

Sequence similarity search of ITS sequences of #1088 AMSTITYEL was performed using BLAST algorithm software (parameters for BLAST search: searched database: others (Nucleotide collection), BLAST algorithm–somewhat similar sequences (blastn), filter used—low complexity regions) at NCBI website. The ITS sequences were aligned with retrieved sequences of reference taxa obtained from BLAST using Clustal W option in MEGA 5. The alignment file involved 11 sequences, which comprised of 1 sequence under study, 9 sequences from BLAST search, which are representative sequences of respective genera/species and one Mycosphaerella africana species which served as an outgroup to root the tree. The aligned sequences were trimmed, so as to make alignment uniform, and the aligned files were then saved in FASTA and MEGA format. The evolutionary history was inferred using the maximum likelihood method based on BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix in MEGA5. A discrete gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites [five categories (+G, parameter = 0.6046)]. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated (Nei and Kumar 2000; Tamura et al. 2011).

Morphotaxonomy
Morphotaxonomy of the endophytic isolate #1088 AMSTITYEL was done by growing it over PLA (Pine Leaf Agar) and incubated at 26 °C for 3–4 weeks in dark. The morphological and microscopic characters were critically observed and recorded. The microscopic characters were studied using a Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope (Nikon, Japan) coupled with CCD camera and measurements carried out using NIS elements D3.2 software. At least 30 observations were made per structure (Abdollahzadeh et al. 2010).

Results and discussion
Isolation of endophytic fungi

Aegle marmelos is an important medicinal plant as documented in ayurvedic pharmacopeia for variety of therapeutic properties, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, hepatoprotective, and so on. It has recently been documented to possess anti-thrombotic activity too (Chougule et al. 2014). Based on the hypothesis that endophytes produce putative phytochemicals similar to their host, we chose to screen and evaluate the fibrinolytic activity of endophytic fungi from A. marmelos. In this study, 48 endophytic fungal isolates were isolated from the stem tissue of A. marmelos. They belong to different genera, including Alternaria sp., Aureobasidium sp., Botryosphaeria sp., Fusarium sp., Pestalotiopsis sp., and Pheoacremonium sp., and certain endophytic fungi, such as Neofusicoccum parvum and Togninia sp., were isolated in their teleomorphic form. Botryosphaeria (CF: 27.5 %) was the most dominant genus followed by Fusarium (CF: 21.25 %), Pestalotiopsis sp. (CF: 5 %) and Pheoacremonium sp. (CF: 3.75 %). Botryosphaeria sp. and Pestalotiopsis sp. were isolated from both the sampling sites, whereas Fusarium and Aureobasidium sp. were isolated only from Yelandur. Similarly, Pheoacremonium sp. and Alternaria sp. were only isolated from Wayanad wildlife sanctuary. This study was aimed at exploring the fibrinolytic activities of endophytic fungi particularly Botryosphaeria species isolated from A. marmelos. Several endophytes, such as Fusarium sp., Alternaria sp., Rhizoctonia sp., and Curvularia sp., have been reported from A. marmelos. Fusarium sp. was the most dominant endophytic fungal isolate followed by Alternaria sp. (Gond et al. 2007; Meshram et al. 2012). However, this is the first study of the presence and diversity of Botryosphaeria sp. as endophyte in A. marmelos.


Screening for proteolytic and fibrinolytic activities
As evident from the screening procedure, cell-free culture filtrate of 40 % of the endophytic fungi exhibited proteolytic activity, while only 18 % of them exhibited fibrinolytic activity. Proteolytic and fibrinolytic activity of the cell-free culture filtrate was evident by formation of a clear zone or halo around the well there by depicting the degradation of respective substrate. Maximum proteolytic activity was shown by culture filtrate of fungal isolate #1088 AMSTITYEL followed by #11 AMSTYEL and # 1095 AMSTWLS (Fig. 1). The cell-free culture filtrate of only four endophytic fungi exhibited in vitro extracellular fibrinolytic activity. The maximum fibrinolytic activity was expressed by isolate #1088 AMSTITYEL with a fibrinolytic halo of 113.04 mm2. The fibrinolytic halo formation in the in vitro plate assay ranged between 50.24 and 113.04 mm2 (Table 1; Fig. 2). The cell-free culture filtrate exerted direct as well as indirect hydrolysis of fibrin clot. The zone of clearance was similar in both plasminogen rich and plasminogen free plates indicating that the enzyme activity does not work as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Fungal fibrinolytic enzymes, such as CMase, Fu–P and verticase, are not a plasminogen activator, whereas herinase is a bifunctional enzyme (Li et al. 2007; Cui et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2009b; Choi et al. 2013). The fungal isolate #1088 AMSTITYEL exhibited a significantly better fibrinolytic profile when compared with Bionectria sp. (66.7 mm2) and Cladosporium sp. (58.3 mm2) (Rovati et al. 2010). Li et al. (2007) screened 23 endophytic fungi residing in Trachelospermum jasminoides for their fibrinolytic property. Verticillium sp. Tj33 was the most potential producer of fibrinolytic enzyme amongst the screened endophytes. Similarly, among 1075 screened endophytic fungi, fermentation extract of Fusarium sp. CPCC 480097 exhibited the strongest fibrinolytic activity (Wu et al. 2009b).Fig. 1 Screening for proteolytic activity (on 1 % w/v skimmed-milk agar plates) in culture filtrate of endophytic fungal isolates of A. marmelos.

Partial purification and characterisation of fibrinolytic enzyme
Ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by dialysis, SDS–PAGE and fibrin zymography was used to assess the fibrinolytic potential of the extracellular proteins expressed by the endophytic fungal isolate #1088 AMSTITYEL. The amount of protein present in cell-free culture filtrate was 1804.17 mg. The specific fibrinolytic activity exhibited was 1.77 U/mg. The crude protein obtained after ammonium precipitation was 18.54 mg exhibiting 2.79 U/mg of specific fibrinolytic activity. Subsequent dialysis of crude protein leads to further purification of the protein fraction. Protein obtained after dialysis was 13.82 mg exhibiting a specific 3.56 U/ml of fibrinolytic activity. The protein from each purification step was when subjected for fibrinolytic activity; an increase in halo formation was observed (Table 2). The fibrinolytic activity of the partially purified protein increases with each purification step. In addition, a twofold increment was observed in fibrinolytic activity of an enzyme. Similar increase in the activity was observed in Fu–P, herinase, verticase, and CMase fibrinolytic enzyme (Li et al. 2007; Cui et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2009b; Choi et al. 2013).Table 2 Purification steps of fibrinolytic enzyme from Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae #1088 AMSTITYEL

The crude protein of #1088 AMSTITYEL resolved into six bands of various sizes that ranged from 26  to 80 kDa. According to fibrin zymography, single protein band was responsible for the fibrinolytic activity exhibited by the crude enzyme extract. When the fibrin zymogram was developed, the fibrin degradation was attributable to a protein of molecular weight ~80 KDa (Fig. 3). The molecular weight of the microbial fibrinolytic enzyme varies from 17 to 51 kDa (Peng et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2009b), but the fibrinolytic activity of #1088 AMSTITYEL is attributed to 80-kDa protein, which depicts the novelty of the protein that has yet not been explored.Fig. 3 Eletrophorectic analysis of crude enzyme extract of #1088AMSTITYEL.

Taxonomic identification
Endophytic fungal isolate #1088 AMSTITYEL was identified using molecular and morphotaxonomic tools.

Molecular taxonomy
The phylogenetic tree resolved into two major clades: Clade I and Clade II. Clade I clustered #1088 AMSTITYEL along with five other species of Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae. In Clade II, three species of L. theobromae were grouped, and L. gonubiensis was resolved basal to the tree. Mycospherella Africana was used as outgroup to root the tree (Fig. 4). Thus, the fibrinolytic enzyme producing isolate #1088 AMSTITYEL was identified as Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae. Other fibrinolytic enzyme producing fungi, such as Fusarium sp. BLB and Fusarium sp. CPCC 480097, were also identified using similar approach (Ueda et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2009a).Fig. 4 Maximum likelihood tree based on the ITS1–5.8S–ITS2 region of Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae #1088 AMSTITYEL.

Morphotaxonomy
Colonies floccose: grey-to-green coloured, fast growing colony with the formation of aerial hyphae. Hypha (2.66−) 3.83 ± 0.79 (−4.97)-μm thick, highly branched, brown-colored, septate, broad, thick walled. Conidiomata pycnidial, uniloculate, dark brown to black, immersed in the medium becoming erumpent when mature. Paraphyses cylindrical, aseptate, ends rounded up 58-μm long, 3-to-4-μm wide arising from the conidiogenous cells. Conidiogenous cells (11.44–) 17.17 ± 3.14 (–22.04) × (2.89–) 4.98 ± 1.23 (–6.8)-μm hyaline, smooth, cylindrical, slightly swollen at the base, holoblastic, proliferating per currently to form one or two closely spaced annulations. Conidia (23.65–) 27.41 ± 1.7 (–31.69–) × (11.49–) 13.5 ± 0.81 (–14.86) μm, ellipsoidal, apex and base rounded, widest at the middle, thick-walled, initially hyaline and aseptate and remaining so for a long time, becoming one septate and dark brown (24.71–) 28.2 ± 2.18 (–31.07) × (13.5–) 15.87 ± 1.28 (–18.93) μm only some time after release from the conidiomata, with melanin deposits on the inner surface of the wall arranged longitudinally giving a striate appearance to the conidia (Fig. 5). The morphological features of the isolate #1088 AMSTITYEL corresponded with typical Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae morphology, thereby suggesting it to be a Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae species.Fig. 5 Morphological features of #1088 AMSTITYEL after 30 days of incubation. a Colony over PLA plate. b Colony reverse view (Bar a–b: 10 mm). c Hyphae. d Conidiogenous cells with paraphysis. e Immature conidia. f–g Mature conidia (Bar, c–g = 10 µm)




Concluding remarks

Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are key enzymes in seed germination. The purified mung bean LOX has resolved into two peaks by chromatofocusing, one has highest LOX activity with an isoelectric point of 5.84 and the other has lowest LOX activity with an isoelectric point of 5.52. The purified LOX has molecular mass of approximately 97 kDa and showed high activity with linoleic acid than linolenic acid and arachidonic acid. The optimal activity of LOX was observed at pH 6.5 and temperature 35 °C. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) studies revealed that the purified mung bean LOX possess secondary structural elements with significant α-helix and β-strands. Further, the secondary structure of mung bean LOX was stable up to 60 °C at pH 6.5. Biophysical and chemical properties of the mung bean LOX are similar to the other legume LOXs and may be considered as type-1 LOX.

Introduction
Lipoxygenases (LOXs, linoleate: oxygen oxidoreductases, EC: 1.13.12.11) represent a large gene family of non-heme, non-sulfur iron or manganese containing dioxygenases which are ubiquitously distributed throughout nature indicating the biological and evolutionary importance of these enzymes (Joo and Oh 2012). LOXs catalyze the regio- and stereo-specific dioxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) containing (1Z, 4Z)-pentadiene system (Kuhn and Thiele 1999). Evidences suggested that the primary products generated by these enzymes are called as hydroperoxides, which act as substrates for the synthesis of short chain carbonyl compounds, involved in plant growth, host–pathogen interactions, defense, development and senescence (Brash 1999; Gfeller et al. 2010; Siedow 1991). LOXs are also known to play a major role in production of volatile substances, which influence the flavor and aroma of food from the plants and have wide applications in food industry as they play important role in maintaining food quality and the aroma of food grains (Suzuki et al. 2010).

Germination is the most critical step in the life cycle of spermatophytes and represents the entry of plants into the ecosystem, during which a seed from a dormant embryonic state enters into a highly dynamic phase leading to seedling establishment (Weitbrecht et al. 2011). Germination begins with imbibition and terminates with seed coat rupture and radicle protrusion through the endosperm (Kong et al. 2015). During germination, lipid bodies are degraded in seeds by a new set of proteins, among which, LOXs are playing an important role (Feussner et al. 2001).

During the past few decades, many isoforms of LOX were identified from different plants and their physical and enzymatic properties are characterized. Although occurrence of LOXs in vegetables and fruits is known, it has been reported that legumes are rich source for LOXs, among them soybean seed LOXs were well studied at molecular level (Feussner and Wasternack 2002; Kolomiets et al. 2001). Three isoforms of LOX were identified and characterized from soybean seeds based on their pH optimum, substrate specificity, product formation, kinetic parameters and enzyme stability (Axelrod et al. 1981; Clemente et al. 2000; Kolomiets et al. 2001). Apart from soybean, other legumes have also been reported as good source of LOX proteins. Legumes are inexpensive source of LOX proteins and particularly high level of LOX activities were identified from various legume seeds (Rao et al. 1998). Mung bean was identified as a novel source of LOX in the natural production of green-note aroma compound, hexanal, it is also considered as a cheap and readily available staple food in Asia (Chow et al. 2007). Further, mung bean and its seedlings have been used as a source of hydroperoxide lyase enzyme (Rehbock et al. 1998). Previously, high levels of LOX activity have been reported in germinating seedlings of mung bean (Devi et al. 2005; Rao et al. 1998). Earlier we reported a full-length LOX from mung bean germinating seedlings, during developmental stage more level of LOX expression was observed (Kotapati et al. 2015). However, no reports were available to date on purification and characterization of LOX from mung bean.

In the present study, considering the importance of LOX proteins in food industry, a report on the isolation and biochemical properties of purified LOX from mung bean seedlings is presented.

Materials and methods
Plant material and chemicals
The mung bean seeds were obtained from Sri Venkateswara Agricultural University, Tirupati. Soybean LOX, ETYA, Linoleic acid, Linolenic acid, Arachidonic acid, Sephadex G-100, DE-52, Poly Buffer Exchangers 94 (PBE-94), Phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), EDTA, Acrylamide, Bis-acrylamide, Coomassie brilliant blue, Lauryl sulphate (SDS) and protein size markers were procured from Sigma Chemicals Co (St. Louis, MO, USA). NDGA was a generous gift from department of chemistry, S.V. University. All other chemicals were reagent grade procured from Merck, Mumbai, India.

LOX protein extraction and purification
Extraction and purification methods for mung bean LOX was adopted from Clemente et al. (2000) and Roopashree et al. (2006) with minor modifications. In brief, finely ground powder of mung bean seedlings was extracted with ice cold hexane to make it defatted. About 30 g of defatted fine powder was extracted with 300 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, at 4 °C for 3–4 h and centrifuged at 10,000×g for 30 min. The fine supernatant was dialyzed against 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 24 h with three buffer changes and centrifuged at 25,000×g for 20 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against 40 % poly ethylene glycol 20,000 for 16 h and then centrifuged at 25,000×g for 20 min. The dialyzed sample was applied to Sephadex G-150, gel filtration column (100 × 2.5 cm) and fractions were collected with a fraction size of 2.5 ml per tube at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. The active fractions were pooled and further purified by ion exchange chromatography (DEAE 52, column 3 × 30 cm). Bound protein was eluted using a linear salt gradient [0 mM (150 ml) to 300 mM (150 ml)] sodium phosphate buffer [pH 6.8] and fractions were assayed for protein and LOX activity. At the end of this purification step, two protein fractions were obtained, one with high and the other without LOX activities. To determine the isoelectric points of mung bean seedling LOX, the peak with high LOX activity fractions was pooled, concentrated and dialyzed to remove salt, centrifuged at 25,000×g for 20 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was applied on the PBE-94 chromatofocusing column (3 × 12 cm) which was saturated with 5 ml of gradient buffer (Poly buffer 94, 1: 8, pH 4.0) to create a pH gradient in column. The flow rate was adjusted to 8 ml/h and elute was collected in 1 ml per fraction. The protein in each fraction was read at 280 nm and assayed for LOX activity. The pH of each fraction was determined by using a KL-009 (1B) pocket size pH meter. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C until otherwise mentioned.

SDS-PAGE
SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (1970) using 12 % gels. The proteins were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 in methanol:water:acetic acid (60:30:10) for few hours and then washed in destaining buffer until protein bands appear.

Activity staining
Sample containing 50–100 µg LOX protein of germinated seedlings extract was separated on 8 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without adding SDS to the gel and running buffer (0.025 M Tris–HCl and 0.192 M glycine, pH 8.8) at 4 °C as suggested by Heydeck and Schewe (1984). In brief, following the isozymes separation, gels were washed briefly with phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), and incubated in substrate solution for 5 min at room temperature. After incubation the gels were washed quickly with 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), and incubated in staining solution with O-diansidine-HCl (50 mg O-Diansidine-HCl dissolved in 10 ml absolute ethanol under heating and add this solution to 90 ml of 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8). The electropherogram which has LOX enzymes converts the fatty acid substrate into fatty acid hydroperoxides. These hydroperoxides oxidize both the amino groups of 3-3′ methoxybenzidine hydrochloride forming the chromophores. The chromophores give a reddish brown colour by which the presence of isoenzymes could be localized.

Enzyme assay
Lipoxygenase activity was measured as previously described using Jasco V-530 UV–VIS spectrophotometer at 25 °C by monitoring the increase in absorbance over a period of time at 234 nm (Reddanna et al. 1990). The typical reaction mixture contains 2.8 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), appropriate volume of enzyme (10–100 µl) and the reaction was initiated by addition of substrate to the reaction mixture and maintained to have 250 µM for linoleic acid in the total volume. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the µmol of hydroperoxide formed per min−1 mg−1 protein.

Kinetic parameters
Effect of pH and temperature
The optimum pH for mung bean LOX activity was investigated using linoleic acid as substrate at 25 °C within the pH range of 3.0–10.0. The effect of ionic strength on mung bean LOX enzyme activity was tested using different concentrations of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) from 10 to 200 mM. To figure out the optimum temperature of mung bean LOX enzymes, activity was measured using pre-incubated standard assay mixture for 10 min at the indicated temperature (20–80 °C). After incubation, samples were cooled to 25 °C and the remaining LOX activity was determined.

The kinetic parameters of mung bean seedling LOX were measured under standard assay conditions using substrate concentrations in the range of 2–400 μM. All determinations were done in duplicate and respective kinetic parameters were calculated from Line-weaver Burk (LB) plot.

Effect of inhibitors on mung bean seedling LOX activity
Effect of two known LOX inhibitors on mung bean LOX activity was investigated under standard conditions using different concentrations of ETYA (0–300 µM) and NDGA (0–500 µM). The stock solutions of both inhibitors were prepared in 100 % alcohol. The inhibitors were pre-incubated with enzyme for 5 min and assay was performed as mentioned in previous sections.

Circular dichroism (CD) studies of mung bean seedling LOX
Circular dichroism (CD) experiments were carried out using Jasco J-715 Polari meter. CD measurements were performed using homogeneous samples at a protein concentration of 60–80 μg/ml in 10 mM phosphate buffer at appropriate pH as described by (Barone et al. 1999). Far-UV CD spectra were recorded from 200 to 250 nm using 0.1 cm light path quartz cuvettes under continuous nitrogen flow. A special acquisition spacing of 0.1 nm was used and each spectrum was averaged four times and smooth curves were made. The thermal stability of mung bean LOX was investigated from 25 to 80 °C at different pH conditions.

Results and discussion
Purification and characterization
The enzyme was purified to 27folds by chromatographic (gel filtration, ion exchange and chromatofocusing) methods. The detailed description of mung bean LOX purification is given in Table 1. Loss in LOX activities (40–50 %) of broad bean, french bean and horse bean was reported when ammonium sulfate fractionation was used as an initial purification step (Feussner and Wasternack 2002). Hence ammonium sulfate precipitation was avoided in the initial step of purification. Instead, an albumin-enriched fraction was obtained as mentioned by Kuo et al. (2006) and is considered as initial step for further purification. Proteins with purification fold 3.5 were obtained in albumin fraction. During gel filtration chromatography a broad single peak of mung bean LOX protein was eluted with purification fold of 3.8 and a specific activity of 22.24 U/mg protein. Finally, anion exchange chromatography yielded two protein fractions upon NaCl salt gradient elution, one with high and the other without LOX activity with purification fold of 4.6 with 26.7 U/mg specific activity (Fig. 1a, b; Table 1) and which was considered for further characterization. The mung bean LOX active protein fraction was resolved into two isozymes on chromatofocusing (Fig. 2). The first isozyme has an isoelectric point of 5.84 and showed high specific activity (160 U/mg) with purification fold of 27. The second has an isoelectric point of 5.52, showed low specific activity (11.11 U/mg) and with purification fold of 2.0, which eventually lost its activity during the purification process. The pI values of mung bean LOX are closely related to English pea and soybean LOX isoenzymes (Eriksson and Svensson 1970). The SDS-PAGE purified mung bean LOX (first isozyme fraction) showed a single band with an approximate molecular mass of 97 ± 5 kDa and greater than 90 % purity (Fig. 3a). The molecular mass of mung bean LOX is similar to broad bean, faba beans, soybean, durum wheat and pea LOXs as reported (Barone et al. 1999; Clemente et al. 2000). Activity staining on native PAGE of mung bean seedlings extract showed two brown enzymatically active bands which indicate the presence of two LOX isoenzymes during seedling growth (Fig. 3b). Based on the activity staining, presence of multiple bands suggest that perhaps two or more isoenzymes will be expressed in later stages of plant development and each will play important roles in plant growth and defense (Haydar and Hadziyev 1973).Table 1 Summary of purification methods employed for lipoxygenase purification from mung bean germinating seedlings

Kinetic studies
The optimal pH for mung bean LOX was found to be 6.5. More than 50 % loss in mung bean LOX activity was observed below pH 4.5 or above pH 8.0; however, considerable LOX activity was noted with in a pH range 4.5–8.0 (Fig. 4a). The effect of ionic strength on mung bean LOX enzymatic activity revealed the maximal activity at 50 mM concentration of sodium chloride (Data not shown). Although appreciable LOX activities were observed between 50 and 150 mM salt concentrations, reduced enzyme activities were noted below 50 mM salt concentration (Fig. 4a). Mung bean LOX showed maximal activity at 35 °C and retain its activity up to 60 °C (Fig. 4b). However, significant decrease in enzyme activity was observed at higher temperature (over 50 °C). The optimal pH and temperature studies of mung bean LOX are closely identical to other plant LOXs (Feussner and Wasternack 2002; Kolomiets et al. 2001).Fig. 4 Optimal conditions for mung bean LOX activity. a Effect of pH on purified mung bean LOX. Different buffers were prepared at 50 mM concentration and adjusted to defined pH values. b Effect of temperature on purified mung bean LOX. Samples were pretreated for 10 min at given temperature and then assayed for LOX activity under standard conditions




Substrate specificity of mung bean LOX was determined using linoleic, linolenic and arachidonic acids, and kinetic constants were obtained (Table 2). The apparent K
m of mung bean LOX for three substrates tested is 79.79, 135.5 and 253.1 μM (Fig. 5). Given data suggest that linoleic acid is preferred substrate for mung bean LOX when compared with linolenic and arachidonic acids. The apparent K
m and V
max values of mung bean LOX are closely relevant with the other legumes like germinating barley (van Aarle et al. 1991), soybean (Axelrod et al. 1981; Dainese et al. 2010), durum wheat semolina (Barone et al. 1999) and broad bean (Clemente et al. 2000) LOX isoenzymes.Table 2 Characteristics of lipoxygenase purified from mung bean seedlings

Two well-known LOX inhibitors, ETYA and NDGA, were tested to investigate the effect on mung bean LOX (Fig. 6). The calculated IC50 of ETYA and NDGA with mung bean LOX were 18.18 ± 1.2 and 48.07 ± 3.2 µM, respectively. The inhibition kinetics of two LOX inhibitors, ETYA and NDGA, followed competitive and non-competitive mode of inhibition, respectively. Similar kind of inhibition constants were reported for soybean type-1 LOX and type-2 LOX, and human LOX-5 (Kohyama et al. 1997; Kolomiets et al. 2001; Nagabhushana et al. 2002).Fig. 6 Effect of inhibitors on mung bean LOX activity.

Circular dichroism (CD) studies
Far UV-circular dichroism spectra of mung bean LOX showed a negative dip at 208 and 222 nm, indicating the existence of predominant secondary structure with significant α-helix and β-strands (Fig. 7a). Further, temperature effect on mung bean LOX as function of its secondary structure at optimal pH showed that the secondary structures were stable up to 60 °C and the secondary structures were destabilized upon further increase of temperature (Fig. 7b). Thermal stability of mung bean LOX was also depicted by measuring the dichroic activity at 222 nm as a function of temperature. A Sigmoid decrease in ellipticity at 222 nm was observed with increase in temperature and the inflection point of 60 °C at optimal pH. The CD data of mung bean LOX is consistent with LOX activities measured at different temperatures whereas loss in enzymatic activities was observed over 60 °C at optimal pH. These data suggest that, the mung bean LOX secondary structure is pH and temperature dependent and significant loss in enzymatic activity is due to loss in secondary structure of protein (Graff et al. 1990).Fig. 7 Circular dichroism analysis of purified mung bean LOX. a Far-UV CD spectra. Measurements were made at 25 °C in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). b Temperature effect on mung bean LOX as function of secondary structure.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have purified and characterized the mung bean lipoxygenase by biophysical and biochemical analysis. Mung bean LOX that we purified has similar properties like soybean LOX1 type. Our findings also suggest that presence of multiple isoforms in seedlings perhaps play key roles in developmental stages. Although the predominant isoform in mung bean is LOX1, detailed characterization of other isoforms can also be considered useful as the by-products of LOX subtypes have industrial applications. Our recent cloning data also suggest the presence of multiple isoforms in mung bean. As mung bean is one of the food sources, the present study will serve as basis for detailed analysis of mung bean LOX isoforms and their roles in mung bean related food products.

In the present study, Agave atrovirens fibers were partially characterized, thermal pretreated and used as support, substrate and inducer source for cellulolytic complex production by four strains of the genus Trichoderma, where T. asperellum was selected as the best option for this process after evaluating the enzyme activity and the invasion capacity on the pretreated Agave fibers. Fungi were able to grow on the Agave fibers secreting the complex cellulolytic enzyme. Results show Agave fibers as a good carbon source and support for T. asperellum for the production of the cellulolytic complex (endoglucanase 12,860.8 U/g; exoglucanase 3144.4 U/g; and β-glucosidase 384.4 U/g). These results show the promising potential this material could have in the production of the active enzyme cellulase complex.

Introduction
The Agave, a native plant of Mexico, grows in desert and semi-desert areas. In 2012 the sown area in Mexico was about 137,626.27 ha and 19,876.07 Ha only were harvested, which gives a production of 1,686,337.41 t of Agave, with a price of 96 dollar/t (SIAP 2012). The main use of this crop is for beverages production, such as Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque, but this is only with some species like Tequiliana weber var azul and Angustifolia per example. A minority of these plants are used to make knitting yarns, paper and as limiting barrier in some areas; certain towns use the leaves to cook traditional Mexican dishes. As a result a large quantity of these plants have no use in the area. When the Agave flower appears it can reach 10 m high and after that the Agave plant dies, because this flower consumes all the disposable sugars present. So it is necessary to emphasize the importance in making use of the produced Agave crops that nowadays does not have a real use, though it could be used to obtain considerable amounts of fermentable sugars, oligosaccharides, composite and diverse materials, in addition to the alcoholic beverages.

To obtain many of these mentioned products, it is necessary to degrade the complex fibers of the Agave leaves.

The Agave cell wall composition is structured mainly by cellulose and hemicelluloses that can be hydrolyzed to simple sugars the action of fermentation. The third major component in the Agave cell wall is lignin, which has a negative effect in the hydrolysis of polysaccharides and is the main cause of the recalcitrance of the cell wall, that is the resistance of cell walls to be converted into fermentable sugars. The percentages of these three main components is variable between crops. For example, the cellulose percentage may vary from 65 to 85 between different species. The hemicellulose content could be from 3 up to 11 % in some species. And the lignin can be present in different species from 7 up to 16 % (Escamilla-Treviño 2012; Nava-Cruz et al. 2015).

Other important components of the cell wall in Agave plants, mainly in the leaves are the water-soluble carbohydrates, also called non-structural carbohydrates, which are released after thermal treatment. In some species, such as Agave tequiliana weber, these components can be present in 90 % of the dry matter (Mancilla-Margalli and Lopez 2006). In this kind of carbohydrates, fructans is the main component of the polymers. There is also present in this complex wall, the non-structural sugars, but these in much lower levels decreasing from the base to the top.

One of the most promising ways is the use of cellulases, which have the capacity to hydrolyze such leaves, resulting in fermentable sugars that can be used in different ways. For that reason the production of a cellulase complex using friendly ways that does not compromise all the factors involved is necessary. Cellulose is a polymer of glucose bound by β-1,4 linkages. But not all the cellulose materials have the same chain length and the level of interaction between chains (Cowling 1975). In waste cellulose between 40 and 60 % is cellulose, the rest are divided in hemicelluloses, lignins and other residual materials (Eveleight et al. 2009). The use of lignocellulosic materials for this objective is also increasing. These materials are cheap, abundant and renewable; all these features make the material appropriate to use as substrate in the fermentation process to produce cellulases (Maeda et al. 2011).

Nowadays, there is a crucial need to produce cellulases with better specifications and through natural materials and ways. Cellulases hold the third place worldwide in enzyme industry by dollar volume (Rani et al. 2010). This group of enzymes are formed by three single enzymes: endoglucanases, exoglucanases and β-glucosidases; the first ones hydrolyze the cellulose polymer exposing reductive and no reductive ends of the linear polymer of glucose, while the second ones attack these terminations to liberate cellobiose and cellooligosaccharides (Bansal et al. 2011; Deswal et al. 2011; Talebnia et al. 2010). The β-glucosidases (BGL) will join the cellobiose units to liberate finally the desired product, glucose (Sukuruman et al. 2009; Yah et al. 2010). Degradation process of cellulose consists of a six-step complicated process; the last one is a uniform catalysis process that includes participation of β-glucosidase on cellobiose (Chauve et al. 2010).

The interest in producing cellulases using new sources is increasing and new catalytic features are required. Several microorganisms capable of degrading the cellulosic material have been reported; actually there is a variety of studied microorganisms with special features such as aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (Gilkes et al. 1991; Kumar et al. 2004; Thirumale et al. 2001) soft and white rot fungi (Chung-Yi et al. 2009; Lo et al. 2010; Shrestha et al. 2009; Tanaka et al. 2009) and anaerobic fungi (Dashtban et al. 2009; Ljungdahl 2008). In some cases the cellulases are secreted as free molecules, like the example of filamentous fungi, actinomycetes and aerobic bacteria. The most used microorganisms to produce these kinds of lignocellulosic enzymes are filamentous fungi such as Trichoderma, Fusarium, Phanerochaete, Penicillium, etc. (Bak et al. 2009; de Siqueira et al. 2010; Javed et al. 2007; Lo et al. 2010; Mathew et al. 2008). The aim of this study was to produce cellulases in solid-state fermentation using as unique carbon source, inducer and support, Agave atrovirens fibers, by the action of a strain of Trichoderma spp.

Materials and methods
Fungal strains and materials
A set of 4 strains of Trichoderma identified as Trichoderma harzianum (T1-04), Trichoderma asperellum (T2-31) and 2 different more only known as Trichoderma spp. codified as Trichoderma T2 and Trichoderma T2-11 were obtained from the micoteca of the Autonomous Agrarian University Antonio Narro, and the T2 were obtained from the micoteca of the Autonomous University of Coahuila, both in Saltillo Coahuila, Mexico. The strains were reactivated in PDA at 28 °C until they have enough spores to make a suspension with Tween 80.

The Agave plant was collected also in the first University. Potato agar dextrose (PDA) was purchased in Sigma Aldrich as well as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), p-nitrophenyl, β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) and the compounds of the Mandels medium. Paper filter strips of 1 × 5 cm (50 mg, Whatman #1), citrate buffer pH 4.8, 0.05 M were also used in this study.

Agave fiber characterization
The fibers of Agave atrovirens were characterized as previously reported by (Medina et al. 2011) to measure the cellulose content by a gravimetric technique with the acid and neutral detergent fiber method (Van Soest et al. 1991) with two different types of fibers; the first one is a hydrothermal treatment and the second one a chemical treatment with NaOH. In the hydrothermal treatment the fibers were peeled and sliced into small squares (2 × 2 cm approximately), then the pieces were autoclaved for 30 min to 120 °C. After that, the material was dehydrated in an oven to 70 °C for 48 h. The reducing sugars present in the fibers were partially removed by multiple washing cycles with boiling water. The fibers were dried and then milled in a grinder (Mussatto et al. 2008; Flores-Maltos et al. 2014).

For the chemical treatment the fibers were peeled and sliced into small squares (2 × 2 cm approximately) and dehydrated in an oven at 70 °C for 48 h. The material was then milled in a grinder and placed in an NaOH solution (2 %) in a relation of 1:20. This was autoclaved by 30 min at 120 °C. The material was washed, filtered and dehydrated at 70 °C (Medina et al. 2011).

The cellulose content was evaluated by a gravimetric technique (neutral detergent fiber method) using 0.5 g of the sample heated to boiling in 100 ml of neutral detergent plus 50 µl of heat stable amylase added before the beaker is placed on heat. At this point sodium sulfite is added (0.5 g). Then the sample is boiled for 1 h and filtered on sintered glass coarse crucible or Whatman 54 paper.

In the acid detergent fiber (ADF) the procedure was according to the AOAC. This procedure avoided the use of decalin. The Klason lignin procedure was developed at the same time.

For both kind of fibers were also measured the total and reducing sugars with citrate buffer 50 mM at pH 4.8 and 50 °C (Trevelyan and Harrison 1952; Miller 1959), respectively, and the pH.

Agave fibers pretreatment
In this part were used the last two procedures described above (hydrothermal and chemical) to evaluate which one gives the best results in growing and enzyme activity, so hydrothermal and chemical procedures were evaluated for strains (T2-31, T1-04, T2-11 and T2). Radial growth and enzyme activity were evaluated to choose the best pretreatment of the fibers.

Strain selection
Kinetics were run for the four strains of Trichoderma (previously mentioned) to observe the radial growth and find which strain can adapt more easily to the Agave atrovirens fibers. The fermentations were realized in 6-cm-diameter petri dishes to observe the radial growth, using 3 g of dried fibers and adjusted to 80 % humidity with the Mandels medium (NH4)2 SO4 (1.40), KH2PO4 (2.03), CaCl2 (0.30), MgSO4·7H2O (0.30), peptone (1.0), and a trace metals solution from FeSO4·7H2O (0.005), MnSO4·4H2O (0.0016), ZnSO4·7H2O (0.0014), CoCl·6H2O (0.02), urea (0.3), yeast extract (0.25), CuSO4·5H2O (0.001) (in g/l), and for this stage, the dishes were inoculated with an explant (1 cm diameter) of a previously reactivated strain for each of them. The kinetics were stopped when the first strain reached the limit of the Petri dish (84 h).

With respect to radial speed of growth, the distance reached after 12 h for each strain to the cardinal points (North, South, West, East) were measured and then the velocity per strain was calculated.

At the end of the fermentation (84 h) enzymatic activity for the three components of the complex (exoglucanase, endoglucanase and β-glucosidase) to the obtained extract was measured; protein and total sugars were also measured as is described below. Thereby, the best enzymatic activity titers and the radial growth were used as criteria for choosing the strain to be used in the fermentation.

Growth analysis
To observe the growth pattern presented by the selected strain of Trichoderma in the Agave fibers, and the adaptation level to the substrate and support, scanning electronic photomicrographs of the initial and final time (84 h) of the first fermentation for radial growth were taken. The samples were taken directly from the reactor, using 1 g of fibers in a thermo-balance at 110 °C until the samples were dried. The samples were placed in aluminum slides and subjected to an environmental scanning electron microscope (Phillips XL30-ESEM) with low vacuum at 20 keV (kilo electron volts) with a distance of 7.5 mm and a spot size of 4.5.

Time course of cellulase production in SSF
The strain with best results in the previous stages was selected to realize a kinetic and observe the time with the best enzyme activity. The conditions for the fermentation were the same as used in the selection fermentation, and the fibers were also adjusted to 80 % humidity with Mandels medium and incubated at 29 °C for 312 h. An inoculum of the spore suspension obtained from a previous strain reactivation (1 × 107 per gram of fibers) was added to the fibers. To collect the samples each 24 h 14 plates (reactors) in triplicate were assembled.

Cellulase production in SSF bioreactors
The enzyme production was realized using 1 kg fermentation trays, and using as support and substrate Agave atrovirens fibers (200 g dry weight). The humidity was adjusted at 80 % as before with Mandels medium. This reactors were performed three times corresponding to the highest enzyme activity points. An inoculum of the spore suspension (1 × 107/g of fibers) was added in the medium, obtained from the previous reactivation (7 days), all this material was carefully homogenized and incubated at 29 °C for 216, 240 and 312 h to obtain the best titers in each enzyme.

Crude extract recovery
For the strain selection 20 ml of citrate buffer (pH 4.8, 0.05 M) was used for each tray and was carefully homogenized for 2 min, and separated with a muslin cloth. Thereby the obtained extract was kept in congelation for further analysis. For obtaining the enzymatic extract, 1 kg of fermented mass from fermenter trays was put under manual pressure without any additional buffer. The fermented material was put in a muslin cloth and squeezed, the obtained liquid stored in congelation for further analysis.

Analytical determinations
Exoglucanase activity
Exoglucanase activity was analyzed according to the Roussos modification method (1985); Whatman filter No. 1 paper strips (substrate) were collocated in tubes with 1 ml of the buffer and 1 ml of the sample (reaction mix), it was incubated at 50 °C for 1 h in a thermo bath, and then reducing sugars were determined with Miller’s method (1959). An enzyme blank and a substrate blank were used, the first one contained the substrate (1 strip) and the buffer (1 ml), and the second one contained the enzymatic extract (1 ml) and the buffer (1 ml). To calculate the final absorbance, the blanks were added themselves and then subtracted from the reaction mix; after that formula (1) was used to calculate the international units of enzymatic activity. One enzyme activity unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 µmol of glucose per minute under the assay conditions. 1 UL=gL×vol rxnvol ext enz×1mol180gmol×1×106μmol1mol×1rxn time vol = volume; rxn = reaction; ext = extract; enz = enzyme.

Endoglucanase activity
This activity was performed using Roussos adaptation method (1985). It consists in a reaction mix of 1 ml of CMC (1 % in citrate buffer pH 4.8, 0.05 M) and 1 ml of the enzymatic extract. It was incubated in a thermo bath for 30 min at 50 °C, and after that reducing sugars were determined to the samples with Millers method. The international units of enzymatic activity were calculated by the same Eq. (1). This assay also used the enzyme and substrate blanks.

A qualitative analysis was also performed to prove endoglucanase activity, using CMC (0.2 %) in a citrate buffer (0.05 M, pH 5) with agarose (1 %) in petri dishes. The extract (50 μl) was placed in the middle of the solidified mixture and the reaction was maintained for 10 min. After that, the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. The plate was washed with distilled water ten times, with 10-min rest between washings. The dish was covered with Congo red (0.1 %) and left for 1 h, after that it was washed with NaCl (1 M) five times, giving 10 min between washing.

β-Glucosidase activity
This activity was determined by Vattem and Shetty method (2002). 100 µl of p-NPG (9 Mm) was used as substrate, then 100 µl of the crude extract with 800 µl of the citrate buffer (0.05 M, pH 4.8) was added. Mix reaction, substrate and enzyme blanks were also used as previously. All assays were performed in triplicate.

Quantitative enzyme assay
A 0.2 % carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in citrate buffer 50 mM with pH 5 was prepared. Agarose (1 %) was added and placed in petri dishes to form a gel. 50 µl extract fermentation were located in the middle of the plate and after 10 min were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h in humidity presence to avoid dehydration. The sample was washed with distilled water at intervals of 10 min between each washing. The sample was dyed with Congo red (0.1 %) and after 1 h the sample was washed with NaCl 1 M to remove excess.

Other analysis
The extracts obtained from the fermentation were also analyzed for protein using the Bradford method (1976), and for total sugars using the Dimler method (Dimler 1952). All assays were performed in triplicate.

Results
Agave fiber characterization
Table 1 summarizes the results of the different analysis realized to the pretreated fibers. The content of cellulose found in the Agave atrovirens fibers was about 23.48 % with hydrothermal treatment, and 67.12 % w/w for the chemical treatment. The total sugars found in the hydrothermal one were 0.16 and 0.73 g/l in the chemical one. The reducing sugars are 0.04 and 0.07 g/l for hydrothermal and chemical, respectively. The pH was 5.40 for the hydrothermal and 6.56 in the chemical one.Table 1 Partial characterization of the Agave atrovirens fibers

Treatment	Cellulose (%)	Total sugars (g/l)	Reducing sugars (g/l)	PH	
Hydrothermal	23.48	0.16	0.04	5.40	
Chemical	67.12	0.73	0.07	6.56	



Agave fibers pretreatment
The chemical pretreatment did not have influence on the microbial growth in the fibers with any strain and in consequence the enzyme activity was not expressed. The hydrothermal pretreatment shows growth with the four strains, so for this reason, the selected pretreatment was the hydrothermal one. This pretreatment results in a bigger surface area for the enzymatic system induced for the carbon source through Trichoderma.


Strain selection
The radial growth for each strain was measured and the average in the growth rate obtained. Enzymatic activity was also tested. The results are given in Table 2.Table 2 Cellulase production in SSF bioreactors

Enzyme	Time (h)	Enzymatic activity (U/g)	
Exoglucanase	240	3144.4 ± 87.4	
Endoglucanase	216	12,860.8 ± 186.3	
β-Glucosidase	312	384.4 ± 26.6	



The growth rate did not represent a significant difference between strains, the four strains were able to grow in the fibers with similar speed, causing the excretion of cellulolytic enzymes by the strains.

The enzymatic activity presented by Trichoderma asperellum (T2-31) at 84 h was higher than the other strains, with 606.4 U/g of exoglucanase, 1213.2 U/g of endoglucanase and 582 U/g of β-glucosidase at 84 h. These results are very high compared with the other three strains, which make a suitable strain to the next steps in the investigation. This shows its capacity to degrade the fibers in a better way for the secretion of enzymes with good cellulolytic activity.

Growth analysis
In Fig. 1a can be seen the Agave fibers without growth, while in Fig. 1b the Agave fibers appear wrapped by mycelium after 84 h of incubation under the conditions mentioned before. Only the images of Trichoderma asperellum T2-31 are shown in the agave fibers, since it was the strain with better features in growing and enzyme activity in comparison with the other three.Fig. 1 Growth analysis of Trichoderma asperellum on Agave atrovirens fibers with a hydrothermal pretreatment




These micrographs demonstrate the capacity of Trichoderma to grow using the Agave fibers as substrate and support.

Time course and cellulase production
The fermentation with Trichoderma asperellum was maintained until 312 h, and the sampled each 24 h. The maximum activity was detected at 240 h for exoglucanase with 932 U/g (Fig. 2), while endoglucanase presented its maximum activity at 216 h giving as result 6116 U/g (Fig. 3), and finally the β-glucosidase presented at 312 h with 640 U/g (Fig. 4).Fig. 2 Exoglucanase activity

Carboxymethylcellulose plate dyed with Congo red. a Blank (without fermentation extract). b Sample with fermentation extract in the surface




Cellulase production in SSF bioreactors
Since the times of highest enzyme activity are known, the solid-state fermentation was performed in bigger reactors, using aluminum trays of 1 kg. One tray for each of the enzymes was collocated and stopped at different times (216, 240 and 312 h). The tray of 216 h gave 12,860.8 U/g of endoglucanase, the fermentation stopped at 240 h showed 3144.4 U/g of exoglucanase and the fermentation at 312 h give 384.4 U/g of β-glucosidase (Table 2).

Quantitative enzyme assay
In Fig. 5 it can be seen in part (a) the blank of the sample were no extract cocktail fermentation was added, and all the carboxymethylcellulose plate are intact. In part (b) it can be seen how the extract fermentation cocktail acts in the carboxymethylcellulose degrading the surface, evidenced by the Congo red dye.

Other analysis
The total sugars quantified by the Dimler method were present in 67 g/l at the beginning of the fermentation and at 312 h were only present with 18 g/l (Fig. 6). These data show the sugar intake by Trichoderma, using up an average of 20 g/l in the first 24 h and after this 4 g/l per day. A slight increase in the total sugars present in the extract could be seen at 216 h with 9 g/l more than the previous sampling followed by the consumption of 20 g/l in the next 24 h, and then another increase of 8 g/l with a normal previous tendency of 4 g/l each 24 h.Fig. 6 Total sugars during fermentation with Trichoderma asperellum





The protein quantification (Fig. 7) shows that at 144 h of fermentation the maximum protein in the extract is present with 0.111 g/l, followed by a decrease until 0.058 g/l at the end of the fermentation.Fig. 7 Protein content in the fermentation with Trichoderma asperellum





Discussion
The percentage of cellulose found is higher in the NaOH-pretreated fibers and this should be for the removal of interfering compounds with the alkaline treatment, which expose widely the inside content (Medina et al. 2011). Martin et al. (2006) reported 57.9 % w/w cellulose in Agave fourcroydes which is similar to that reported here, while Caspeta et al. (2014) reported 43 % cellulose in Agave bagasse. The amount found is influenced by the used method.

In the characterization of the Agave fibers, the total and reducing sugars in the chemical treated fibers are higher than the hydrothermal ones, owing to the opening in the fibers structure that allows the release of more compounds, including carbohydrates as pentose (Hartree et al. 1987; Kumar et al. 2008).

The pretreatment selected to the fibers was the hydrothermal one due to the zero growth with the chemical one, probably caused by the formation and release of interferential compounds with the NaOH interaction with the fibers, as saponins, flavonoids ant others Güclu-Üstündag and Mazza (2007).

The hydrothermal pretreatment given to the fibers changes the crystalline unreactive form of the cellulose to an amorphous structure that facilitates the access to the cellulose material. This benefits the accessibility to the enzyme complex because of the disruption of the cellulose–hemicellulose–lignin structure and stirring compounds (Kumar et al. 2008).

In the strain selection analysis presented in Table 3, it can be seen the strain T2-31 with very high levels of endoglucanase compared with the other three strains, the same result but not with such difference with the exoglucanase and β-glucosidase is shown. This could be probably explained because this specie presents a better adaptability to the agave fibers in order to a synergic enzyme release of the three components of the cellulolytic complex, which makes in set the best performance of this four strains of Thrichoderma. The suitable features of Trichoderma asperellum have been also reported in many biochemical processes because of its enhanced cellulose production and lower catabolite repression. Same features are observed in the present investigation (Raghuwanshi et al. 2014).Table 3 Growth velocity and enzyme activity for the strain selection

Units of β-d-glucopyranose bound by β-(1 → 4) glycosidic links result in the polysaccharide known as cellulose (Kumar et al. 2008). To hydrolyze this polymer, in the fermentation process, the action of three enzymes is necessary that in this study, Trichoderma asperellum has shown can produce. This complex is formed by exoglucanase, endoglucanase and β-glucosidase. The time where the three enzymes present the maximum activity corresponds with the common mechanism of the complex enzyme, where the first enzyme appearing is endoglucanase, producing nicks in the cellulose polymer and then the exoglucanase acts to release cellooligosaccharides and finally the β-glucosidase liberate the final product, glucose (Rani et al. 2010). Kellermann and Rentmesiter (2013) and Kumar et al. (2008) reported that in the hydrolysis of amorphous cellulose a ratio of 6:2:1 is commonly seen between endoglucanases, exoglucanases and β-glucosidases, respectively.

The large period of hydrolysis and the prolonged time in the presence of the enzymes could be associated to various factors, one of them, could be a strong binding in the insoluble cellulose (Lan et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2004). Other option associated to this phenomenon could be an important quantity of enzyme linked in that insoluble cellulose, Zhou et al. (2004) mentioned that, those cellulase adsorbed is similar to the present in the crude extract, and also mentioned that cellulose can be calculated by the difference between the initial protein concentration and the final one. In this study, that cellulose adsorbed was calculated (data not shown) and demonstrate that the cellulose adsorbed, in each one of the three enzymes, was the same as the cellulose analytical calculated. It is important to mark that this work is not optimized and diverse physical and chemical factors such as pH, temperature, adsorption, nitrogen, phosphorous, phenolic compounds and some inhibitors can improve or affect the bioconversion of the lignocellulosic material (Kumar et al. 2008).

Table 4 shows different species of fungi used with the same aim. Raghuwanshi et al. (2014) reported the use of a mutant strain of Trichoderma asperellum SR7 under optimized conditions in the degradation of wheat bran with titers of exoglucanase of 2.2, 13.2 IU/g of endoglucanase and 9.2 IU/g of β-glucosidase in periods ranging from 4 to 7 days. These results show the same specie strain but mutated, with titers well below the obtained in the present investigation, revealing the huge capacity of this strain Trichoderma asperellum to degrade a very difficult substrate as the Agave fibers. The big difference in the period time is important, but still that point, our results shows more than 1000 times more activity in the double of time. There are several species of fungi used for the same purpose, but each one with different production times, therefore a direct comparison is difficult.Table 4 Comparison of cellulase production by Trichoderma asperellum with other fungi under SSF

The challenge in this cellulase production process is the maintenance of optimal conditions to the maximal enzyme production, which needs a balance between diverse factors to avoid the change from a productive state to a nonproductive, that in this case was not yet studied; however, the data shows the capacity of Trichoderma asperellum to degrade a complex matrix of cellulose, as Agave atrovirens fibers.

The analysis of total sugars suggest that the sugars produced by the saccharification of the Agave fibers, was constantly consumed by Trichoderma asperellum, which coincide with the time in the enzymes shown its maximum activity, allowing us bearing out that more than the sugars present in the extract, we can find some corresponding to the produced by the enzyme complex.

The tendency in the protein concentration is similar to that showed by the enzyme concentration, suggesting that the enzyme present in the extract was active.


Agave fibers of different species have been used to evaluate the effect of various factors present in the saccharification of Agave leaves using commercial cellulases or for the production of bioethanol (Li et al. 2014; Medina et al. 2011; Saucedo-Luna et al. 2011). Kalia and Vashistha (2012) reported the use of Brevibacillus parabrevis in the modification of the surface of Agave sisilana fibers for composite fabrication, and as a result bacterial cellulase treatment improves the features of the material such as thermal and crystallinity, as well as giving a smooth and shiny surface. But they do not report enzymatic titers, since the main objective was the scanning of the Agave fiber surface.

Conclusions

Trichoderma asperellum is able to grow using as carbon source and support the Agave atrovirens fibers pretreated with a hydrothermal process, releasing an enzymatic complex of cellulase made up by exoglucanase, endoglucanase and β-glucosidase, being the second most active in the degradation of the Agave fibers, resulting in promising fermentable sugars.

We greatly thank the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT-Mexico) for the scholarship given to this investigation. And specially to each one of the authors and reviewers who contributed in this work.

The effect of purification strategies plays a crucial role in getting maximum recovery of yield, purity and biological activity of recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT). In the present work, the task of purifying rhAT from Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 has been carried out using two different approaches such as cross flow filtration (CFF) system and chromatography methods. In the first approach, the protein was concentrated and partially purified through CFF to achieve maximum recovery yield and purity of 87 and 94 %, respectively. In the second approach, purification involved a single step chromatography with various types of ion exchange and size exclusion resins to analyze the maximum rhAT recovery yield and purity. From the experimental results, it has been observed that the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) technique with Superose 12 matrix was suitable for the purification of rhAT and achieved the maximum recovery yield and purity of 51 and 97 %, respectively. Further, to acquire a high recovery yield and purity of rhAT, the effect of various chromatographic conditions such as mobile phase, mobile phase pH, flow rate, sample volume and sample concentration were also investigated. Under the optimal chromatographic conditions, rhAT was significantly recovered and purified in a single step with maximum recovery yield, purity and biological activity of 67, 99 % and 410 IU/L, respectively. Based on these investigations, it was concluded that SEC with Superose 12 matrix was a more suitable and a potential method for the purification of rhAT.

Introduction
Antithrombin (AT) is a plasma glycoprotein (432 amino acids) and a member of serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) family, which is an important physiological controller of various clotting factors, including thrombin, factor IXa, Xa, XIa, and XIIa (Rosenberg and Damus 1973; Franzen et al. 1980). The inactivation of thrombin by AT under normal physiological conditions is slow, but the rate of complex formation increases in a high degree by heparin cofactor activity (Machovich et al. 1976). AT has a therapeutic significance for those who suffer from venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with acquired or inherited inadequacy of AT activity (Beresford and Owen 1990). In these situations, an adequate supply of pure AT is essential.

Nevertheless, AT is available from human plasma (Büntemeyer et al. 1994; Munzert et al. 1997), from the view of product safety and possible virus infection (retrovirus and hepatotropic viruses), AT production must be only way through recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology (Zettlmeissl et al. 1987). AT has been produced using different expression systems like E. coli, Chinese hamster ovary cells and Pichia pastoris, COS 1 monkey kidney cells, BHK (baby hamster kidney) cells, Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells, and transgenic goat milk (Bock et al. 1982; Wasley et al. 1987; Zettlmeissl et al. 1988, 1989; Gillespie et al. 1991; Edmunds et al. 1998), but yeast-based recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT) has been demonstrated only by Broker et al. (1987).

To have the capacity to isolate a desired protein from a mixture, the physicochemical properties of the target protein should be used. Till now, there is no single or simple process to purify all kinds of proteins. On the other hand, if the protein is intended for clinical use, it ought to be very pure. But, as considered to be in economic view, purification should be done in a single step.

The main objective of a purification process is not only the exclusion of undesired contaminants, but also the purification of the target protein (Roe 2001). Ion exchange chromatography (IEC) is certainly the most commonly used technique for the separation and purification of proteins, polypeptides, nucleic acids, poly nucleotides, and other bio molecules. The explanations behind the accomplishment of IEC are its determining power, broad relevance, high capacity, and the effortlessness of the system (Bonnerjea et al. 1986). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is another purification process, in which components are filtered according to their size, and in some times molecular mass. It is frequently used to purify the larger or macro molecules such as proteins and industrial polymers (Paul-Dauphin et al. 2007).

In the present study, purification of rhAT from Sacharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 has been carried out using two different approaches such as cross flow filtration (CFF) and chromatography methods to achieve high recovery yields and purity. In addition, the effect of various physicochemical parameters such as mobile phase, mobile phase pH, flow rate, sample volume and sample concentration on rhAT purification were also investigated.

Methods
Chemicals and instrumentation
Tris or Tris aminomethane and 2-mercaptoetahnol were procured from Merck Millipore (USA). Fraction V or Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF) were obtained from Sigma (Germany). rhAT reference standard was purchased from NIBSC, UK. SDS-PAGE Mini-PROTEAN three apparatus was procured from Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., (USA). Recombinant human AT was produced in a Minifors fermentor (Infors HT, Switzerland). The Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) AKTA Prime Plus system, resins (stationary phase), bioprocess glass column (BPG XK16/20) for purification, cross flow filtration (CFF) system and the hollow fiber membrane cartridge (30 kDa) were purchased from GE Healthcare Life sciences (Uppsala, Sweden). The chromatographic data were recorded and analyzed by Prime View Evaluation™ software version 5. 31. Reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) equipped with UV/Vis (SPD 20A Prominence) detector was acquired from Shimadzu Corp. (Kyoto, Japan). The Jupiter 300 Å C4 LC column (250 × 4.6 mm) obtained from Phenomenex (USA).

Production of rhAT
Large scale production of rhAT in S. cerevisiae BY4741 was performed in a fed-batch cultivation mode with a media volume of 3 L in Minifors HT bioreactor (Infors HT, Switzerland). The fermentation process was carried out in the following conditions: temperature 30 °C, pH 7.1, 40 % dissolved oxygen (DO). The foaming was controlled with a silicon antifoaming agent. The culture was induced with galactose (2 %) at an OD600 nm of 0.9 (dry cell weight = 11 g/L) of the fermented culture (Kim et al. 2003; El-Sayed et al. 1990).

Cell harvesting and lysis
The fermented broth was harvested and the pellet was collected by centrifugation (Sorvall ST 16 R, Thermo scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) at 4 °C and 40,000×g for 15 min. The pellet weight was calculated as dry cell weight (DCW, g/L). The cells were washed with wash buffer containing 0.05 M EDTA (pH 8.0) and 0.01 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). The cells were lysed by sonication (20 kHz, for 2–4 s time intervals) using lysis buffer containing 0.01 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 % DMSO, 50 mM NaCl,1 mM EDTA, 0.5 % sucrose and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF).

Concentration of rhAT protein solution
After cell lysis, the lysate was concentrated and simultaneously clarified using CFF system with a loading volume of 500 mL. The rhAT protein was filtered through 30 kDa molecular weight cutoff hollow fiber membrane cartridge with nominal flow path length of 30 cm with 650 cm2 of cross-sectional area. The maximum flux (flow) rate from the membrane was allowed at 10 mL/min. The filtration was accomplished using a stable pump speed at 300 rpm. The concentration intensity of the rhAT is distinguished by a concentration factor (f
C) and retention factor (R
f), and these are calculated from the following formula. 1 fc=VF/VC where V
F = feed volume and V
C = final cross (retentate) volume. The retention factor is also a significant parameter for the desired product characterization, and it is described as, the division of components between permeate and retentate. 2 Rf=((CF)2-Cp)/CF where, C
F = feed concentration and C
p = permeate concentration (Vemula et al. 2015).

Purification of rhAT
Two different column chromatography techniques with different resins were selected to analyze the effect of stationary phase on rhAT purification. The principle of IEC with Q-Sepharose and Capto Q and CM Sepharose were applied to evaluate the effect of stationary phase on rhAT purification (Lutkemeyer et al. 1993). Simultaneously, the principles of SEC with three different resins (Sephacryl S200, Sephadex G-100 and Superose 12) were also applied to analyze the effect of stationary phase on yield and purity of rhAT (Štulík et al. 2003). A 25 mL of each stationary phase with 20 % ethanol solvent was filled through 0.2 Mpa pressure in the bioprocess glass (BPG) column (BPG XK16/20). The column was primarily washed with 100 mL of 0.5 M sodium chloride solution with a flow rate of 3.0 mL/min. The column is washed with 100 mL water to remove the salts and other contaminants during equilibration with the mobile phase. For every individual experiment, 2 mL of rhAT protein was loaded and the column pressure was maintained at 0.1–0.2 Mpa during the purification process. 50 mL of salt linear gradient program was run for the purifications from 20 to 100 % sodium chloride solution at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Protein elution profiles were detected at 280 nm. All the purification experiments have been performed at 22 °C.

Analytical procedures
The purity of the rhAT was assessed by reverse phase liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (Vanz et al. 2008) and SDS-PAGE (15 % w/v acrylamide (Faraji et al. 2010). The qualitative analysis of the rhAT was analyzed through RP-HPLC. HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was equipped with LC Prominence SPD 20A UV–Visible detector and LC 20 AT binary pumps. The rhenodyne type of injector port was used to inject the samples. The rhAT analysis was carried out at the following conditions: flow rate 1.0 mL/min, wavelength 280 nm, pressure 80 kgf and controlled temperature 40 °C. The Jupiter 300 Å C4 5 µ column (250 × 4.6 mm) (Phenomenex, USA) was used to analyze the samples. The mobile phase A consisted of water: acetonitrile (87.5:12.5 v/v) and mobile phase B consisted of water: acetonitrile (30:70 v/v). Mobile phase A and B consisted of TFA (ion pairing agent) with the concentration of 0.1 and 0.08 %, respectively. The rhAT was eluted using linear gradient mode with % B to 90 % B in 20 min and 90 % B to 5 % B in 40 min. The purified rhAT concentration was calculated by Bradford assay using BSA as a standard (Tesio et al. 2011).

On the other hand, Purified rhAT III and control was loaded onto 15 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and western blot analysis was performed using polyclonal antibody generated from rabbits and Horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat IgG antibody (Bio-Rad Inc, USA) (Kuwae et al. 2005). The biological potency of the purified rhAT III was measured as heparin cofactor (HC) activity with a commercial assay kit that uses the thrombin-specific chromogenic substrate S-2238 (TESTZYM ATIII kit, Daiichi Pure Chemical, Tokyo).

Results and discussion
Preparation of concentrated solution and fractional purification of rhAT
Cell lysate was concentrated and partially purified by cross flow filtration system using 30 kDa catridge. The rhAT filtration performance is shown in Fig. 1. From the experimental results, the change in rhAT concentrations (0.4, 1.1, 2.6, 3.9, 5.7, 6.8 and 7.2 mg/mL) with change in flux (21, 17.5, 13.6, 10.8, 6.7, 3.5 and 2.9) was observed (Fig. 1) at progressive time intervals (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min). It can be clearly observed that a noteworthy increase in protein concentration has been observed with decrease in flux as a function of time. At a specific time period (180 min), no significant change was observed and a high 7.2 mg/mL of rhAT concentration was obtained with a constant flux of 2.9 mL/min. This effect may be due to the clogging of pores by formation of foam on the surroundings of membrane that constrained the filtration of solution from the membrane. The filtration was ended after recovering 40 mL retentate with a concentration factor of 12.5 and retention factor of 0.87. The rhAT recovery yield and purity after the filtration step was about 87 and 94 %, respectively. Various recombinant proteins such as recombinant human granulocyte stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and monoclonal antibodies have been successfully concentrated with cross flow filtration system and it was achieved with >95 % purity (Vemula et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2010).Fig. 1 Clarification and concentration of rhAT.

Effect of chromatographic resin on rhAT purification
Optimization should evaluate a number of physicochemical parameters including stationary and mobile phase for effective protein purification. Therefore, the studies have been conducted on rhAT purification to analyze the influence of ion exchange and size exclusion chromatographic resins. The recovery yield and purity of rhAT for both ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography with different resins were shown in Table 1. From the results, it can be seen that among various resins selected in both ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography, size exclusion chromatography with Superose 12 showed maximum recovery yield and purity of 51 and 97 %, respectively. The lower yields with ion exchange could be attributed to low permeability and capacities of resins for larger proteins such as antithrombin. Additionally, the hydrophobic character of the ion exchange resin will denature the proteins (Janson 2012). Therefore, further experiments were carried out with Superose 12. The above experimental results obtained in the present work were significantly higher than the work reported by Mak et al. (1996).The effect of various chromatographic resins on recombinant protein (rhG-CSF) purification was also successfully studied by other researchers (Wang et al. 2006).Table 1 Effect of stationary phase on rhAT purification, the maximum yield (51 %) and purity (97 %) of rhAT was shown with Superose 12. The results represent mean values with standard deviation (SD) of three repeated (triplicates) experiments

Purity (%)	96	96	97	97	97	97	



Effect of Mobile phase on rhAT purification
The choice of mobile phase plays a critical role in the purification of proteins because they ought to be adapted to the buffer atmosphere during the elution. In the present work, a study has been performed on four different mobile phases (tris, acetate, phosphate and sulfate) with pH 7.2 using size exclusion chromatography with Superose 12. The recovery yield and purity of rhAT with four different mobile phase buffers were shown in Table 2. From the experimental results, recovery yields (50, 52, 54 and 51 %) and purities (97, 98, 98 and 97 %) of rhAT were obtained with respective mobile phase buffers such as tris, acetate, phosphate and sulfate buffers. From the above result analysis, it was concluded that phosphate buffer has achieved a high recovery yield (54 %) with 98 % purity. The lowest recovery yield (50 %) was achieved with Tris buffer with 97 % purity. However, acetate and sulfate are next to the phosphate with recovery yields of 52 and 51 %, respectively. The results attained in the present work were higher than the previously reported work (Mochizuki et al. 2001).The effect of mobile phase on recombinant protein (rhG-CSF) purification was also successfully studied by other researchers (Vemula et al. 2015).Table 2 Effect of mobile phase on rhAT purification. The maximum recovery yield (54 %) and purity (98 %) of rhAT was shown with Superose 12 matrix. The results represent mean values with standard deviation (SD) of three repeated (triplicates) experiments

Mobile phase buffer	Recovery yield (%)	Purity (%)	
Tris	50 ± 1.1	97	
Acetate	52 ± 1.2	98	
Phosphate	54 ± 1.1	98	
Sulfate	51 ± 1.1	97	



Effect of mobile phase pH on rhAT purification
Purification of proteins is pH dependent, which can definitely affect the recovery yield and purity (Burgess et al. 1987). In the present work, a study has been carried out on phosphate buffer with different pH values ranging from 6.5 to 9 to estimate their effect on recovery yield and purity of rhAT. The recovery yield and purity of rhAT at various phosphate buffer pH values were shown in Fig. 2. From the experimental results, recovery yields (48, 50, 51, 53, 55 and 52 %) and purities (97, 97, 98, 98, 98 and 98 %) of rhAT were obtained with respective mobile phase pH such as 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5 and 9. It has been clearly observed that the maximum recovery yield (55 %) and purity (98 %) of rhAT was observed with buffer at pH 8.5. The lowest recovery yield (48 %) and purity (97 %) of rhAT was observed with buffer at pH 6.5. Even though the purity was high (98 %) at pH 7.5,8 and 9, low recovery yields (51, 53 and 52 %) were observed when compared to pH 8.5.The mobile phase pH on recombinant protein purification was also successfully analyzed by previously reported work (Vemula et al. 2015).Fig. 2 Effect of mobile pH on rhAT purification, the maximum yield (55 %) and purity (98 %) of rhAT was shown with pH 8.5. Filled diamond represents recovery yield; Filled square represents purity. The results represent mean values with standard deviation (SD) of two repeated (duplicates) experiments




Effect of flow rate on rhAT purification
Flow rate should be considered as one of the most significant parameters during protein purification, because in size-based separations, it may influence the protein structure, biological activity and recovery yield. In the present work, a study has been conducted with different flow rates of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mL/min to show the impact of flow rate on rhAT purification. The recovery yield and purity of rhAT at different flow rates were shown in Fig. 3. From the experimental results, recovery yields (59, 66, 61 and 57 %) and purities (98, 99, 98 and 98 %) of rhAT were obtained with respective flow rates such as 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 mL/min flow rate. It can be clearly seen that the high recovery yield (66 %) and purity (99 %) of rhAT was obtained with 1 mL/min flow rate. Although using lower sample flow rates results in longer run times, the increased resolution gives greater confidence and optimum column efficiency (Oliva et al. 2001). The low recovery yield (57 %) was observed with 2 ml/min, due to high acceleration, which increased the chance of escaping and decreased the passage of the sample from the resin resulting in low recovery yields. Though the purity of rhAT is similar at 0.5, 1.5 and 2 flow rates, variations in recovery yields (59, 61 and 57 %) were observed. Hence further experiments were carried out with 1.0 mL/min flow rate. The results obtained in this study were very close to the previously reported work (Wang et al. 2014)Fig. 3 Effect of flow rate on rhAT purification. The maximum yield (66 %) and purity (99 %) of rhAT was shown with 1 mL/min flow rate. Filled diamond represents recovery yield; filled square represents purity. The results represent mean values with standard deviation (SD) of two repeated (duplicates) experiments




Effect of sample volume on rhAT purification
Sample injection volume can influence the protein purification and affects mostly on recovery yields. Therefore, in the present study, several experiments were carried out on rhAT purification with different sample volumes such as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mL. The recovery yield and purity profiles of rhAT with varying sample volumes were shown in Fig. 4. From the experimental results, recovery yields (55, 60, 57, 56 and 58 %) and purities (98, 98, 98, 98 and 98 %) of rhAT were obtained with respective sample volumes such as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mL. From result analysis, it was concluded that the maximum recovery yield (60 %) and purity (98 %) with the sample volume of 2 mL were observed. This is attributed to the suitable volume of the sample that enters through the resin and increases the passage of desired protein molecules. The lowest recovery yields of 55 and 56 % were achieved with 1 and 4 mL volumes, respectively. This is due to broadening of sample zone by increasing the sample volume and decreased the passage of the sample through the resin. Therefore, further studies were continued with 2 mL sample volume.Fig. 4 Effect of sample volume on rhAT purification. The maximum recovery yield (60 %) and purity (98 %) of rhAT was achieved with 2 mL sample volume. Filled diamond represents recovery yield; filled square represents purity. The results represent mean values with standard deviation (SD) of two repeated (duplicates) experiments




Effect of protein concentration on rhAT purification
Sample concentration may also influence the chromatographic resolution and sensitivity (Hong et al. 2012). In the present work, a study has been conducted on different protein concentrations ranging from 1 to 4 mg/ml with Superose 12 matrix to analyze the protein concentration effect on recovery yield and purity of rhAT. Figure 5 shows the recovery and purity of rhAT under various sample concentrations. From the experimental results, recovery yields (63, 67, 61 and 60 %) and purities (98, 99, 99 and 98 %) of rhAT were obtained with respective protein concentrations such as 1, 2, 3 and 4 mg/mL. From the above result analysis, it can be clearly seen that the high recovery yield (67 %) and purity (98 %) of rhAT were achieved with protein concentration of 2 mg/mL. Even though a high purity (98 %) of rhAT was observed with protein concentration of 3 mg/mL, recorded low recovery yields of 61 %. From this study, it was concluded that the loss of recovery yields could be observed with increase in protein concentration due to non-binding interactions of protein with resin.Fig. 5 Effect of protein concentration on rhAT purification. The maximum yield (67 %) and purity (99 %) of rhAT was shown with 2 mg/mL concentration. Filled diamond represents recovery yield; filled square represents purity. The results represent mean values with standard deviation (SD) of two repeated (duplicates) experiments




Optimal conditions for rhAT purification
Based on previous experiments, the optimal chromatographic conditions were preferred for rhAT purification: Superose 12 matrix, phosphate buffer at pH 8.5, flow rate 1 mL/min, sample volume 2 mL and sample concentration is 2 mg/mL. Figure 6 shows the FPLC chromatogram of rhAT eluted under the aforesaid optimized conditions. It can be observed that the single major peak was observed and indicates the monomeric form of rhAT. The major peak appeared with high resolution at a retention volume of 13.3 mL indicating the active fraction of rhAT. The whole chromatographic process was carried out in 25 min. The obtained recovery yield and purity of rhAT under optimum conditions were 67 % and ≥98 %. The above experimental results obtained in the present work were significantly higher than the previously reported work (Büntemeyer et al. 1994; Mochizuki et al. 2001) and obtained results were also very close to the earlier reported work (Wang et al. 2014). Figure 7 shows the RP-HPLC chromatogram eluted from the SEC column under optimized conditions. It can be seen that the purity of rhAT was shown to be 98 as similar with retention time (22.756 min) of standard rhAT.Fig. 6 FPLC chromatogram of rhAT eluted from the SEC column. The maximum yield (67 %) and purity (99 %) of rhAT was shown under optimum conditions: stationary phase: Superose 12; phosphate buffer with pH: 8.5; flow rate: 1 mL/min; sample volume: 2 mL and sample concentration: 2 mg/mL


Fig. 7 RP-HPLC analysis of rhAT, the purity of the rhAT was shown to be ≥98 %




The purity of rhAT was also assessed through SDS-PAGE and western blotting. SDS–PAGE analysis of rhAT III was shown in Fig. 8. A single target rhAT III band confirms the molecular mass of 58 kDa, which is similar to the control (standard rhAT III). On the other hand, gel was transferred to PVDF membrane and the transformation was immuno detected with rhAT III antibodies and a single rhAT III band was shown in Fig. 9, which is analogous to the reference standard. Finally, biological activity of purified rhAT was found to be 410 IU/L measured as heparin cofactor (HC) activity.Fig. 8 SDS-PAGE analysis of rhAT: Lane M marker; Lane 2 purified rhAT; Lane 3 reference standard. A single target band was observed with molecular weight of approximately 58KDa, which is similar to the reference standard

Conclusions
In summary, SEC is found to be an effective technique for rhAT purification and showed a maximum recovery yield (51 %) and purity (97 %) when compared to the IEC recovery yield (48 %) and purity (97 %). Further investigations on physicochemical chromatographic conditions such as mobile phase, mobile phase pH, flow rate, sample volume and sample concentration were also proved their influence on recovery yield and purity. Under the optimized conditions, the maximum recovery yield, purity and biological activity of rhAT was found to be 67, 99 % and 410 IU/L, respectively. The purity was evaluated through various analytical techniques such as RP-HPLC, SDS-PAGE and western blotting.

Mejhoul were evaluated. Different concentrations of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3; 550, 825 or 1650 mg/L), potassium nitrate (KNO3; 633.3, 950 or 1900 mg/L), calcium chloride dehydrate (CaCl2·2H2O; 147, 220 or 440 mg/L), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4; 57, 85 or 170 mg/L), magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O; 123, 185 or 370 mg/L), l-glutamine and myo-inositol (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 g/L), sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol or commercial granulated sugar (10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 g/L) were tested. The highest number of shoot buds per explant (18.7) occurred on the medium containing 825 mg/L NH4NO3, 1900 mg/L KNO3, 220 mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, 170 mg/L KH2PO4, 370 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O as well as 1 g/L l-glutamine, 2 g/L myo-inositol and 30 g/L sucrose. The results showed that the frequency of hyperhydricity significantly increased in media containing 1650 mg/L NH4NO3. The concentrations of l-glutamine, myo-inositol and carbon source significantly affected the number of shoot buds per explant. However, they had no effect on hyperhydricity, tissue browning and precocious rooting. Shoots of 4.5–6.0 cm in length were isolated and transferred onto hormone-free media for elongation and rooting. After 3 months, the developed plantlets were successfully transplanted in a glasshouse and over 90 % survived acclimatization.

Introduction
Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is an agronomically, socioeconomically and ecologically important crop species in the Middle East and North Africa. The worldwide population of date palm trees is estimated to be around 150 million (Al-Khayri et al. 2015). In Morocco, date palm covers 50,000 ha with 5.4 million trees and 453 cultivars (Sedra 2015). Among these cultivars, cv. Mejhoul, also known as Medjool, Medjhool, Medjehuel and Mejhul (Elhoumaizi et al. 2006), is the most sought after and most famous cultivar worldwide (Sedra 2015). Mejhoul is also the most popular and most desired variety by the Moroccan farmers and consumers. Unfortunately, cv. Mejhoul is threatened by bayoud, a very dangerous disease caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. albedinis, which has decimated over 12 million palm trees (Saker 2011), and significantly decreased the population of cv. Mejhoul (Sedra 2011).

To preserve cv. Mejhoul from bayoud and to produce enough plants to satisfy the high demand of farmers and consumers, developing a large-scale propagation system then planting regenerants in bayoud-free areas is the only practical solution. Along this line, a micropropagation program through organogenesis was released in 2010 by the Moroccan Ministry of Agriculture, including cultivars of high fruit quality such as Najda, Boufeggous and Bouskri. The amount of plants of cv. Mejhoul aimed to be produced annually within this program is 67 % of the total amount of plants produced. However, micropropagation of date palm is genotype dependent (Jain 2012), and cv. Mejhoul is one of the most recalcitrant cultivars to in vitro manipulations. Therefore, developing an efficient regeneration system through organogenesis for this cultivar would require a high optimization of media components and culture conditions.

Studies on date palm micropropagation through organogenesis are scarce. In the past few years, regeneration systems through this technique were reported in some cultivars; e.g., cv. Maktoom (Khierallah and Bader 2007), cv. Dhakki (Khan and Bi Bi 2012), cv. Hillawi (Al-Mayahi 2014) and cv. Boufeggous (Mazri 2015). However, the majority of works focused on the effects of plant growth regulators (PGRs). The effects of other factors such as mineral salts, l-glutamine, myo-inositol and carbon source have been scarcely evaluated for date palm organogenesis (Al-Khateeb 2008a; Mazri 2013, 2014; Mazri and Meziani 2013).

Major mineral salts (macronutrients) are inorganic elements needed in relatively large amounts for healthy and vigorous growth of plants (George and de Klerk 2008). Carbohydrates are essential elements for in vitro propagation of plants (Thorpe et al. 2008). They are employed as a source of energy and as an osmotic agent (Thorpe et al. 2008), and to replace the carbon which is normally fixed by plants from the atmosphere by photosynthesis (George and de Klerk 2008). The mineral and carbohydrate requirements for shoot bud proliferation of date palm seem to depend on the genotype used. With regard to l-glutamine and myo-inositol, their effects on date palm organogenesis have never been evaluated. l-Glutamine is an amino acid known for promoting and maintaining cell function (Newsholme et al. 2003). It has been used to promote somatic embryo proliferation, maturation and germination of many plant species, including date palm (Encina et al. 2014; Kim and Moon 2007; Zouine and El Hadrami 2007; Zouine et al. 2005). Myo-inositol is a vitamin that promotes cell and protoplast division (Bellini et al. 1990; Kim et al. 2003; Kiviharju et al. 2005), as well as callus growth (Sepehr and Ghorbanli 2002).

The success of date palm organogenesis is hampered by some physiological disorders: hyperhydricity, a morphological anomaly in which explants are glassy, water soaked and translucent (Debergh et al. 1992); tissue browning, which occurs due to the high levels of caffeoylshikimic acids contained in date palm tissues (Loutfi and El Hadrami 2005); and precocious rooting of organogenic cultures, which decreases bud formation (Al-Khateeb 2008b). The composition of the culture medium affects the incidence of these physiological disorders. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account their occurrence during the optimization of the culture medium.

The purpose of this investigation was to optimize the concentrations of mineral salts, l-glutamine, myo-inositol and carbon source for a rapid and efficient shoot bud multiplication of the recalcitrant date palm cultivar Mejhoul and to examine their effects on the incidence of hyperhydricity, tissue browning and precocious rooting. Accordingly, a total of 70 different culture media were evaluated.

Materials and methods
Plant material and culture conditions
This study used organogenic cultures, comprising four buds each, and obtained from shoot tip explants of date palm cv. Mejhoul as described by Beauchesne et al. (1986) with some modifications in the disinfection process. Briefly, offshoots (3-year-old) were removed from adult trees. The outer leaves were detached then the shoot tip was extracted. The shoot tip was subjected to disinfection with 0.03 % solution of potassium permanganate (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) in commercial liquid bleach (ACE, Industries Marocaines Modernes, Casablanca, Morocco) for 20 min followed by three rinses with sterile distilled water. The explants used for organogenic culture initiation were taken from the meristematic region and then cultured for 9 months on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium (MS/2) supplemented with 30 g/L sucrose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.2 g/L l-glutamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 0.1 g/L myo-inositol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 2 g/L polyvinylpyrrolidone (Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands), 3 mg/L 2-naphthoxyacetic acid (NOA), 1 mg/L 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 1 mg/L indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 0.1 mg/L N6-[2-isopentenyl] adenine (2iP) and 6 g/L agar (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 5.6 before autoclaving at 121 °C for 25 min at 103 kPa. The explants were maintained in darkness at 25 °C and transferred to fresh medium every 4 weeks.

During the multiplication phase (experiments 1, 2, 3 and 4), all media (Table 1) were supplemented with 0.2 mg/L NOA, 0.2 mg/L IAA, 0.4 mg/L 2iP and 0.4 mg/L kinetin as suggested by Meziani et al. (2015). In all experiments, media were supplemented with 1 g/L polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelled with 6 g/L agar and the pH was adjusted to 5.7 prior to autoclaving for 25 min at 121 °C at 103 kPa. For each experiment, two organogenic cultures were placed in a jar (12 cm in height, 6.5 cm in diameter) containing 40 ml of the culture medium and cultured for 3 months. The explants were maintained at 25 °C in a 16 h photoperiod with a light intensity of 13.5 µmol m−2 s−1 provided by white cool fluorescent tubes, with transfer to fresh medium every month.Table 1 Mineral salts, l-glutamine, myo-inositol and carbon source concentrations tested during shoot bud proliferation of date palm cv.

Experimental protocols
Experiment 1: effects of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and potassium nitrate (KNO3) concentrations on shoot bud proliferation
Organogenic cultures of date palm cv. Mejhoul were cultured on media consisting of various concentrations of NH4NO3 (550, 825 or 1650 mg/L) and KNO3 (633.3, 950 or 1900 mg/L); as well as 220 mg/L calcium chloride dehydrate (CaCl2·2H2O), 185 mg/L magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O), 85 mg/L potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4), 30 g/L commercial granulated sugar (Cosumar, Casablanca, Morocco), 0.25 g/L l-glutamine, 0.25 g/L myo-inositol, vitamins and minor salts of MS medium.

Experiment 2: effects of CaCl2·2H2O, MgSO4·7H2O and KH2PO4 on shoot bud proliferation
Organogenic cultures were cultured for 3 months on media containing 825 mg/L NH4NO3, 1900 mg/L KNO3 (these concentrations were chosen according to the results from experiment 1), 30 g/L commercial granulated sugar, 0.25 g/L l-glutamine, 0.25 g/L myo-inositol, vitamins and minor salts of MS medium, and supplemented with various concentrations of CaCl2·2H2O (147, 220 or 440 mg/L), KH2PO4 (57, 85 or 170 mg/L), and MgSO4·7H2O (123, 185 or 370 mg/L).

Experiment 3: effects of l-glutamine and myo-inositol on shoot bud proliferation
In this experiment, four concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 g/L) of l-glutamine and myo-inositol were evaluated. l-Glutamine and myo-inositol were supplemented to the culture medium that was containing 825 mg/L NH4NO3, 1900 mg/L KNO3, 220 mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, 170 mg/L KH2PO4, 370 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O (based on the results of experiments 1 and 2), 30 g/L commercial granulated sugar, vitamins and minor salts of MS medium.

Experiment 4: effects of carbon source type and concentration on shoot bud proliferation
According to the results from the above experiments, and to evaluate the effects of carbon sources on shoot bud multiplication, organogenic cultures were cultured on media containing 825 mg/L NH4NO3, 1900 mg/L KNO3, 220 mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, 170 mg/L KH2PO4, 370 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O, 1 g/L l-glutamine, 2 g/L myo-inositol, vitamins and minor salts of MS medium, and various concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 g/L) of sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol (all purchased from Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) or commercial granulated sugar.

Shoot growth and acclimatization
For shoot elongation and rooting, 4.5–6 cm-long shoots were isolated from the organogenic cultures that were on the medium containing 825 mg/L NH4NO3, 1900 mg/L KNO3, 220 mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, 170 mg/L KH2PO4, 370 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O, 1 g/L l-glutamine, 2 g/L myo-inositol, 30 g/L sucrose, vitamins and minor salts of MS medium as well as PGRs. The shoots were cultured for 3 months on this same medium at 25 °C and 16 h photoperiod (40 µmol m−2 s−1), but without PGR. After the elongation–rooting phase, well-rooted plantlets with three to four leaves were transferred to the glasshouse as described by Mazri and Meziani (2013). Briefly, the plantlets were removed from the culture medium. The roots were washed in tap water then soaked for 15 min in a fungicide solution (1 g/L Pelt 44 PM; Bayer CropScience, Bayer Maghreb SA, Casablanca, Morocco). The plantlets were then transferred to plastic bags with a mixture of peat–gravel (1:1) substrate. The bags were placed in a polyethylene tunnel for 2 weeks (98 % relative humidity). After this period, the polyethylene tunnel was gradually opened to adapt plantlets to glasshouse conditions (70 % relative humidity; 27 °C).

Data collection and statistical analysis
During the multiplication phase, there were ten replicates of each treatment, and each replicate consisted of one jar containing two organogenic cultures. After 3 months of culture, the mean number of shoot buds per organogenic culture, the mean number and length of precociously formed roots, the intensity and percentage of hyperhydricity and tissue browning were recorded. During the elongation–rooting phase, the recorded data after 3 months were shoot length (cm) and the mean number and length (cm) of roots. After 4 months in the glasshouse, the percentage of plantlets survival was calculated.

Data were analyzed by ANOVA using a completely randomized design at 5 % significance level, and the comparison of means was performed with the Student–Newman–Keuls test at P ≤ 0.05 (SPSS v. 16.0, IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). Percentage data were arcsine transformed prior to analysis.

Results
Experiment 1: effects of NH4NO3 and KNO3 concentrations on shoot bud proliferation
Various combinations of NH4NO3 and KNO3 were evaluated. The maximum capacity for shoot bud formation was observed on the medium containing 825 mg/L NH4NO3 and 1900 mg/L KNO3, in which the average number of shoot buds per explant was 14.5. The use of NH4NO3 at the concentration of 1650 mg/L increased significantly (P ≤ 0.05) the incidence of hyperhydricity (Fig. 1a) and decreased the multiplication rate (Table 2). In addition, the buds formed on the medium containing 825 mg/L NH4NO3 and 1900 mg/L KNO3 were thicker and more vigorous. The different concentrations of NH4NO3 and KNO3 did not affect the frequencies of browning and precocious rooting.Fig. 1 Shoot bud multiplication, elongation, rooting and acclimatization of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) cv.

aThe standard concentrations habitually used for shoot bud proliferation




Experiment 2: effects of CaCl2·2H2O, MgSO4·7H2O and KH2PO4 on shoot bud proliferation
After 3 months of culture, the concentrations of 220 mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, 370 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O and 170 mg/L KH2PO4 stimulated shoot bud proliferation, with an average of 15.3 shoot buds per explant (Table 3). Lower concentrations of CaCl2·2H2O, MgSO4·7H2O and KH2PO4 showed lower multiplication rates, while the concentration of 440 mg/L of CaCl2·2H2O did not increase the number of shoot buds per explant. On the other hand, it has been found that CaCl2·2H2O, MgSO4·7H2O and KH2PO4 concentrations do not affect hyperhydricity, tissue browning and precocious rooting of explants.Table 3 Effect of different concentrations of calcium chloride dehydrate (CaCl2·2H2O), potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4·7H2O) on shoot bud proliferation of date palm cv.

Intensities of hyperhydricity, tissue browning and precocious rooting are visually estimated as +, ++ and +++ for low, moderate and high, respectively




The findings of the first and second experiments demonstrated that the concentrations of the macro-elements employed do not affect tissue browning and precocious rooting of explants. The concentrations of 825 mg/L NH4NO3, 1900 mg/L KNO3, 220 mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, 370 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O and 170 mg/L KH2PO4 are the most appropriate for shoot bud multiplication of date palm cv. Mejhoul.

Experiment 3: effects of l-glutamine and myo-inositol on shoot bud proliferation
The combination of 1 g/L l-glutamine and 2 g/L myo-inositol was found to be optimal for shoot bud proliferation. In fact, the average number of shoot buds per explant significantly increased to 17.6 with this combination, with no significant difference (P > 0.05) with the combination of 1.5 g/L l-glutamine and 2 g/L myo-inositol, in which an average of 17.5 shoot buds per explant was obtained (Table 4).

Experiment 4: effects of carbon source type and concentration on shoot bud proliferation
After 3 months of culture, an average of 18.7 shoot buds per explant was obtained on the medium supplemented with 30 g/L sucrose. The use of sorbitol, mannitol and commercial granulated sugar at the same concentration showed lower multiplication rates (17.6–17.9 shoot buds per explant; Table 5). Higher sucrose concentrations did not increase the number of shoot buds, while lower concentrations produced lower number of shoot buds per explant (13.9–17.1). The buds produced on media supplemented with sucrose (Fig. 1b) were morphologically superior to those obtained on media supplemented with sorbitol, mannitol and commercial granulated sugar.Table 5 Effect of carbon source type and concentration on shoot bud proliferation of date palm cv.

Comparison of standard and improved media
The final improved medium for shoot bud multiplication of date palm cv. Mejhoul contained 825 mg/L NH4NO3, 1900 mg/L KNO3, 220 mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, 170 mg/L KH2PO4, 370 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O, 1 g/L l-glutamine, 2 g/L myo-inositol and 30 g/L sucrose. The average number of shoot buds produced in the improved medium was 18.7, while it was 12.9 in the standard medium (Table 6). The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) and the increase gained was 44.96 %.Table 6 Comparison of shoot bud proliferation of date palm cv.

Shoot growth, rooting and acclimatization
Shoot elongation and rooting (Fig. 1c) were achieved on a PGR-free medium consisting of 825 mg/L NH4NO3, 1900 mg/L KNO3, 220 mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, 170 mg/L KH2PO4, 370 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O, 1 g/L l-glutamine, 2 g/L myo-inositol and 30 g/L sucrose. After 3 months of culture, the average length of shoots was 13.9 cm, the average number of roots per shoot was 4.3 while root length was 4.2 cm, and an interesting survival rate of plantlets of 90 % was obtained after 4 months in the glasshouse (Fig. 1d).

Discussion
In date palm, Mejhoul is one of the most recalcitrant cultivars in tissue culture. In view of developing an efficient regeneration protocol for this cultivar, the most appropriate nutritional requirements for shoot bud multiplication were determined. The concentration of mineral salts strongly affected shoot bud multiplication of date palm cv. Mejhoul. Similar results have been observed in other plant species such as Rubus idaeus L. (Poothonga and Reed 2014), Billbergia zebrina (Martins et al. 2015) and some Pyrus genotypes (Reed et al. 2013). Mineral requirements for date palm-cultured tissue seem to vary among cultivars (Mazri and Meziani 2015). Generally, MS and MS/2 basal formulations have been widely used for date palm shoot bud multiplication. For example, in date palm cvs. Maktoom, Dhakki and Hillawi, MS medium was used (Khierallah and Bader 2007; Khan and Bi Bi 2012; Al-Mayahi 2014), while Mazri  2015 used MS/2 medium for cv. Boufeggous. In a previous study on cv. Najda, the effect of six basal formulations was evaluated and it has been found that MS/2 medium is the most appropriate for shoot bud multiplication (Mazri and Meziani 2013). In cv. 16-bis, MS medium showed higher multiplication efficiency than woody plant medium and Nitsch medium (Mazri 2013). In the present work, the combination of 825 mg/L NH4NO3, 1900 mg/L KNO3, 220 mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, 170 mg/L KH2PO4 and 370 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O considerably stimulated the formation of adventitious buds. It has been found also that hyperhydricity has increased at high concentrations of NH4NO3 in the medium. This confirms previous statements by Al-Khateeb (2008b) and Abahmane (2011) who reported that high levels of ammonium ions increase the incidence of hyperhydricity. On the other hand, the different levels of mineral salts evaluated did not affect the incidence of tissue browning and precocious rooting.

The addition of l-glutamine and myo-inositol at the concentrations of 1 and 2 g/L, respectively, significantly enhanced the proliferation of adventitious buds. l-Glutamine is an amino acid known for promoting and maintaining cell function (Newsholme et al. 2003). It is involved in animal cell division (Diestel et al. 2007) and is known to have anti-inflammatory properties (Jain and Khanna 1981), induce weight loss in overweight and obese human adults (Zambom de Souza et al. 2015) and facilitate genetic transformation of some plant species (Kumar et al. 2013). With regard to micropropagation, l-glutamine has been used to stimulate somatic embryo maturation and germination of many plant species such as Picea mariana (Khlifi and Tremblay 1995), Pinus strobus (Garin et al. 2000), Larix leptolepis (Kim and Moon 2007) and Persea americana (Encina et al. 2014). In date palm tissue culture, studies on the effects of l-glutamine are scarce. Zouine et al. (2005) and Zouine and El Hadrami (2007) reported that l-glutamine improves the proliferation of somatic embryos of cvs. Jihel and Bousthami Noir. The results of the present study indicate that l-glutamine improves also the proliferation of date palm shoot buds. In fact, increasing the concentration of l-glutamine to 1 g/L significantly increased the number of shoot buds per explant.

Myo-inositol is a vitamin that stimulates cell division and an osmotic stabilizer for sustaining cell division (Kim et al. 2003; Kiviharju et al. 2005). Myo-inositol has been used to promote callus growth (Sepehr and Ghorbanli 2002) and protoplast division (Bellini et al. 1990). To date, the effect of myo-inositol on date palm micropropagation has not been investigated. Interestingly, it has been found that myo-inositol promotes shoot bud proliferation of date palm cv. Mejhoul.

With regard to carbon source type and concentration, it has been found that 30 g/L sucrose is the most appropriate for shoot bud multiplication. Lower or higher concentrations of sucrose did not improve shoot bud proliferation. This confirms the findings of Taha et al. (2001), who found that 30 g/L sucrose is more effective than 10, 20 or 40 g/L for the multiplication of shoot buds of date palm cv. Zaghlool. However, in date palm cv. 16-bis, it has been found that the concentration of 20 g/L sucrose is the most appropriate for shoot bud multiplication (Mazri 2014). In cv. Khanezi, sugar type (sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose) did not show a significant difference in bud formation; however, the concentrations of 30 and 60 g/L were the most appropriate in comparison with higher concentrations (Al-Khateeb 2008a). This shows that sugar requirement may differ among genotypes. In the present study, sorbitol, mannitol and commercial granulated sugar appeared to be less effective than sucrose in proliferating shoot buds of date palm cv. Mejhoul. This might be due to the different nutritional and osmotic potentials of these carbon sources, and their different effects on cell growth, differentiation and morphogenesis (Neto and Otoni 2003; Yaseen et al. 2013).

Shoot elongation and rooting were achieved on PGR-free medium as it was previously reported in other date palm cultivars (Mazri 2014, 2015). In fact, it has been found that shoot elongation and rooting on PGR-free media significantly increases the survival rate during the acclimatization phase (Mazri and Meziani 2013). In the present study, the survival rate observed after acclimatization was 90 %. Generally speaking, high survival rates were reported in date palm organogenesis (Khan and Bi Bi 2012; Khierallah and Bader 2007; Mazri 2015; Meziani et al. 2015).

In conclusion, mineral salts, l-glutamine, myo-inositol, as well as carbon source type and concentration significantly affect shoot bud proliferation of date palm cv. Mejhoul. The optimized culture medium will be useful for the rapid and large-scale propagation of this recalcitrant and endangered date palm cultivar. The effect of some natural compounds is currently being investigated to reduce tissue browning during the initiation and multiplication of adventitious buds of cv. Mejhoul.

Targeting hepcidin and lowering its concentration is a possible form of intervention in order to treat these diseases. High turnover rate of hepcidin is a major drawback of therapies directly targeting this peptide. We developed two monoclonal antibodies ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 which inhibit hemojuvelin/repulsive guidance molecule C (RGMc) and downregulate hepcidin. We conducted single-application and dose response studies to understand the antibodies’ mechanism and subchronic toxicology studies to exclude safety-related concerns. Investigation was carried out at different biological levels through qPCR, Affymetrix, liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), histopathology, serum iron, unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), and drug concentration measurements. After a single application of these antibodies, hepcidin expression in liver and its serum protein levels were reduced. Serum iron increased for several weeks. The RGMc antibodies show a pronounced dose response relationship in rats with h5F9-AM8 having an IC50 (UIBC) of approximately 80-fold higher than ABT-207. When hepcidin levels were downregulated, iron deposition in the liver was visible histologically 1 week post application. These antibody-mediated iron depositions were not associated with any adverse toxicologically relevant effect at the doses and time points evaluated. Iron depositions seen after 14 weekly treatments with ABT-207 were reversible in rats and in cynomolgus monkeys. Due to their long-lasting effects and excellent safety profile, both RGMc-blocking antibodies ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 are favorable clinical candidates for diseases characterized by high serum hepcidin levels like anemia of chronic disease.

INTRODUCTION
Anemia of chronic disease (ACD), also known as anemia of inflammation, is the most common anemia in hospitalized patients (1). ACD’s pathogenesis starts with an inflammatory response which is accompanied by inflammatory cytokine release mediating disease progression. The cytokines reduce production of erythrocytes, facilitate lysis of erythrocytes, and stimulate macrophages to store and retain iron as ferritin which ultimately leads to insufficient iron availability (2). In addition, interleukin-6 stimulates hepatic hepcidin expression and hepcidin in turn induces degradation of ferroportin thereby blocking iron release from macrophages and enterocytes into the circulation (3).

Hepcidin is the master regulator of systemic iron metabolism. It is synthesized in the liver and the synthesis is controlled by repulsive guidance molecule C (RGMc), a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked glycoprotein (aka hemojuvelin) (4). RGMc has been shown to bind to neogenin, an ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein with numerous functions (5), and to bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6). RGMc- and neogenin-deficient mice show a decreased BMP signaling pathway and as a consequence reduced liver hepcidin expression (6, 7) suggesting that they jointly regulated the BMP/Smad-mediated signaling pathway of hepcidin regulation (8).

Due to the increased serum hepcidin levels in ACD, many strategies target hepcidin to reduce its serum levels to prevent ferroportin degradation (9, 10). This enables ferroportin-induced iron to be exported out of the cell. Free iron released by ferroportin will be bound to transferrin in the serum which would then be accessible to consumer cells. Due to hepcidin’s high turnover rate with an estimated production rate of 7.6 nmol kg−1 h−1 and a half-life of 2.3 min in cynomolgus monkeys (11), inhibition of hepcidin can only be achieved by sustaining high dose levels or frequent dosing of anti-hepcidin antibodies.

ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 are humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed at AbbVie. As previously reported, these mAbs possess mid (ABT-207) and high (h5F9-AM8) binding affinity towards repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa) (Demicheva et al. in press Cell Reports 2015) and RGMc. RGMa shares 47% amino acid identity with RGMc (12) and RGMc is conserved in rat, in monkey, and in human (13). Since the rat RGMc protein is responsive to a humanized antibody, most of the animal work was conducted in rats.

Here, we describe these RGMa/c antibodies in detail. RGMc is a crucial constituent of the neogenin-BMP6-BMP receptor complex most important for regulating hepcidin expression. Since both antibodies have long-lasting effects on hepcidin expression, the challenge of high hepcidin turnover rates could be overcome, making these antibodies suitable clinical candidates for the treatment of ACD.

In the first step to characterize these antibodies, we carried out single-dose studies with ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 in rats to understand time-course and duration of effects on iron metabolism. These studies were followed by dose response studies to establish the relationship between the dose of mAbs and the monitored iron metabolism effect. Since these antibodies are potential clinical drug candidates, hepatic microarray analysis and toxicology studies in two species were performed to analyze safety-related concerns. With all these studies, we could determine the no effect level (NOEL) for both mAbs and we could also demonstrate that both these mAbs are well tolerated. In addition, in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) relationship between ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 could be established.

METHODS
Generation of ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8
ABT-207 is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) humanized from a rat hybridoma mAb 5F9. h5F9-AM8 is an antibody affinity-matured from ABT-207 by yeast surface display. Both ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 bind to human, cynomolgus monkeys, rat, and mouse RGMc. They also cross-react with RGMa, another member of the RGM family. However, the observed effect on hepcidin and iron metabolism is associated with RGMc but not RGMa, since an RGMa-specific mAb with no RGMc cross-reactivity failed to show any effect on iron metabolism (data not shown). There was no cross-reaction with other non-RGM molecules observed (e.g., and tissue cross-reactivity with a wide panel of human tissues). The affinity difference between human and cynomolgus monkey RGMc could be due to the different sequences in the binding epitopes of ABT-207 between these two species.

Animal Studies
Single-dose studies were carried out by dosing 200 mg/kg ABT-207 and 20 mg/kg h5F9-AM8 or vehicle intravenously into 8-week-old female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Necropsy was carried out at 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 h and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 weeks post injection (n = 5/group). In the dose response studies, 8-week-old female SD rats were injected with 1, 5, 10, and 60 mg/kg ABT-207 or 0.02, 0.2, 2, and 20 mg/kg h5F9-AM8 intravenously (n = 5/dose/group) with four weekly doses. For the subchronic toxicology studies with rats and monkeys, ABT-207 was given weekly (total, 14 times) to 8-week-old SD rats at 2, 8, 40, and 200 mg/kg (n = 15/sex/group including 5 recovery animals/gender/group) and to 2–5-year-old cynomolgus monkeys at 2, 8, 40, and 160 mg/kg per dose (n = 6/sex/group including 2 recovery animals/sex/group). Additional animals from mid- and high-dose groups were kept for a 12-week recovery phase. Detailed study designs can be found in the supplement data.

Drug Concentration Analysis
This analysis was carried out with Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) immunogenicity assay using serum samples. The detailed protocol can be found in the supplementary section.

Histology
Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and iron staining using Perl’s Prussian blue (PPB) staining method on paraffin tissue sections were carried out using manuals adapted from Bancroft JD (14).

Morphometrics
The morphometric analysis was carried out using Definiens Architect software (Definiens) and analysis was adapted according to Hall et al. (15).

Hematology and Serum Iron and UIBC
Iron parameters (total iron and unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) (Roche Diagnostics)) in serum were analyzed using Roche’s chemistry analyzer cobas c501 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The blood parameters were analyzed using Siemen’s ADVIA 2120.

RT-PCR
Two milligrams of frozen liver tissue was reverse transcribed and TaqMan real-time PCR was carried out for hepcidin as previously described (16). The rat assays that were used were hepcidin (Rn00584987_m1, Applied Biosystems) and beta-glucuronidase (Rn00566655_m1, Applied Biosystems) with FAM-labeled probe detection.

LC-MS/MS Analysis
Hepcidin in serum was analyzed with protein precipitation extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The sample volume was 50 μL and the assay dynamic range was 0.5 to 250 ng/mL. Detailed protocol can be found in the supplementary methods.

RNA Preparation and Gene Array Analysis
RNA was prepared (n = 3) (17) and microarray analysis was performed using the standard protocol provided by Affymetrix, Inc. (Santa Clara) and as previously described (17). The array was then scanned using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). The microarray scanned image and intensity files (.cel files) were imported into Rosetta Resolver gene expression analysis software, version 7.2 (Rosetta Inpharmatics), and analyzed for gene expression changes versus vehicle control rat livers. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (18) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE63200 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63200).

Statistics
Experimental data from each study were tested for normality using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and variance homogeneity using Levene’s test and transformed into logarithm scale if needed. Analyses were assessed by one-way analysis of variances followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc test. Statistical analyses were carried out using Graph Pad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) and JMP 10.0 (SAS Institute) software.

RESULTS
Single-Dose mAbs Effect on Iron Regulation
In the single-dose studies, no effect on hematology parameters such as the erythrocytes, white blood cells, and hemoglobin due to the administration of ABT-207 (at a single dose of 200 mg/kg) and h5F9-AM8 (at a single dose of 20 mg/kg) antibodies could be detected (data not shown). Total iron and UIBC parameters which were measured in serum of animals treated with ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 showed an increase in serum iron and a decrease in UIBC post injection. Animals treated with ABT-207 showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in serum iron and a strong decrease in UIBC up to week 3, and the UIBC level in animals treated with h5F9-AM8 stayed below the level of detection until week 6 (Fig. 1a, b).Fig. 1 Serum iron, serum UIBC, liver hepcidin expression (mRNA), serum hepcidin level (protein), and antibody concentration in female SD rats after a single 200 mg/kg ABT-207 and 20 mg/kg h5F9-AM8 application. Both mAbs were injected intravenously on day 0 and timed necropsy of animals was carried out at different time points. Parameters measured from rats injected with ABT-207 (left diagrams) and h5F9-AM8 (right diagrams) include serum iron and UIBC (a, b), liver hepcidin expression (c, d), serum hepcidin levels (e, f), and antibody concentration levels of ABT-207 (g) and h5F9-AM8 (h) in serum. Statistical analysis shows significant effect (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001) from one-way ANOVA conducting Dunnett’s post-hoc test with 0 h group as baseline.

At the liver messenger RNA (mRNA) level, significant hepcidin downregulation was observed in animals dosed with ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 until week 3 and week 4, respectively. However, a complete downregulation of hepcidin could only be observed in animals treated with h5F9-AM8 (Fig. 1c, d). Similarly, serum hepcidin levels in animals treated with ABT-207 dropped significantly until week 3, and in animals treated with h5F9-AM8, hepcidin levels were below the level of quantification from 24 h to week 2 post application and were significantly decreased at least for another 4 weeks until week 6 post application (Fig. 1e, f). Serum antibody concentration was also measured in serum of all animals involved in both studies. The volume of distribution for ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 are 88.34 and 62.20 mg/kg and the clearance of both mAbs are 0.22 and 0.25 mL/h/kg, respectively. The half-life of ABT-207 in rat is approximately 11.7 days and of h5F9-AM8 is approximately 7.2 days (Fig. 1g, h and the enlarged scale of 0–96 h in Supplementary Figure 1).

During necropsy, one part of liver and spleen tissue were directly fixed in formalin and HE and PPB staining were carried out. All the stained slides were analyzed by an experienced pathologist. Based on the HE staining, changes in iron deposition but no other changes in morphology were observed in the examined tissue (data not shown). The semi-quantitative examination of the iron deposition based on PPB staining was compared to the quantitative method using semi-automated morphometric analysis. In the ABT-207-treated liver, iron deposition was seen between week 1 and week 9 and no evident decrease in spleen iron content was seen. The semi-automated morphometric analysis supported the liver iron content findings; however, at the same time, it showed a decrease in the spleen iron content after application (Supplementary Figure 2A).

The pattern of an increase of liver iron and decrease in spleen iron content was more evident in the analysis of the h5F9-AM8-treated animals. Liver iron content increased at week 1 and the iron deposition was apparent until week 12 (end of study). In the spleen, iron decrease was seen between week 1 and week 9 (Fig. 2). The semi-automated morphometric analysis for this study correlated well to the spleen iron finding, and this analysis also showed that the liver iron content was decreasing after week 7. An intercept between liver iron’s increase and spleen’s iron decrease was spotted at week 10 (Supplementary Figure 2B).Fig. 2 Perl’s Prussian blue staining on liver and spleen sections of rats dosed with ABT-207 or h5F9-AM8. In animals treated with ABT-207, liver iron deposition (a) was visible between week 1 and week 9 and iron reduction (b) in the spleen could be seen within this time frame. In animals treated with h5F9-AM8 (c, d), this observation is more pronounced. Bar represents 3 mm for all panels



Dose Response of mAbs in Selective Iron Regulation-Related Parameters
In order to find a relationship between the dose of the mAbs and the effect on hepcidin and iron, ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 were applied at different doses once weekly for a total of four doses. Increased serum iron levels for animals treated with ABT-207 were observed at 10 and 60 mg/kg/week, and the UIBC level decreased at the same doses (UIBC effect significant at 60 mg/kg/week) (Fig. 3a). In animals treated with h5F9-AM8, a significant increase (p < 0.01) in serum iron and a decrease in UIBC level was observed starting at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/week and at higher doses (Fig. 3b). As expected, the antibody concentrations in serum in both studies were dose related (Fig. 3c, d).Fig. 3 Serum iron, UIBC, and antibody concentration in female SD rats after multiple dosing. ABT-207, h5F9-AM8, and vehicle were applied once weekly for 4 weeks and animals were necropsied 24 h after final dosing. Serum iron levels and UIBC in ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8-treated rats (a, b). Antibody drug concentration levels of ABT-207 and h5F9.AM8 (c, d). Statistical analysis in Fig. 3a, b shows significant effect (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001) from one-way ANOVA conducting Dunnett’s post-hoc test with 0 mg/kg/week group (vehicle) as baseline. Data is displayed in mean and error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM)



In addition, hepcidin mRNA expression in liver and serum hepcidin levels were determined for h5F9-AM8. For both parameters, no differences were seen between vehicle group (0 mg/kg/week) and 0.02 mg/kg/week. However, liver hepcidin mRNA expression and serum hepcidin level decreased proportionally with the dose starting from the minimal effective dose of 0.2 mg/kg/week (Fig. 4a, b). At 20 mg/kg/week, the serum hepcidin level was below the detection limit (Fig. 4b).Fig. 4 Liver hepcidin mRNA expression and serum hepcidin levels in female SD rats treated with multiple doses of h5F9-AM8. Liver hepcidin expression (a) and serum hepcidin level (b) showed dose-dependent decreases of hepcidin at doses higher than 0.2 mg/kg/week and no differences between vehicle and 0.02 mg/kg. Statistical analysis shows significant effect (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001) from one-way ANOVA conducting Dunnett’s post-hoc test with 0 mg/kg/week group (vehicle) as baseline. Data is displayed in mean and error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM)



To elucidate the antibody effect on genes other than hepcidin, a whole genome transcriptomic profiling experiment with liver tissue samples from this study was conducted. The results showed that h5F9-AM8 strongly downregulated hepcidin mRNA expression approximately 20-fold. Some minor upregulation (2–3-fold) for genes involved in oxidative stress protection (mostly at the 20 mg/kg dose) and minor perturbations for select BMPs and ferroportin (Slc40a1) were also observed (Fig. 5). Globally, a minimal number of hepatic gene expression changes were observed (1023 probe sets with a fold change ≥ ±2.0 and p ≤ 0.01 for at least one rat, corresponding to approximately 3.3% of the array).Fig. 5 Whole genome transcriptomic profiling with native liver tissue from animals dosed with h5F9-AM8. Comparison between liver tissue from animals at NOEL (0.02 mg/kg/week) with 0.2 and 20 mg/kg/week is shown. Three rats per dose group (0.02, 0.2, and 20 mg/kg) were randomly selected for gene expression analysis. A minimal upregulation of response to oxidative stress genes (p ≤ 0.05) was apparent only at 20 mg/kg dose. Hepcidin showed a robust downregulation at the 20 mg/kg dose. Shades of green indicate a transcript was downregulated, shades of red indicate upregulation, and black indicates no significant change (numbers indicate fold change relative to vehicle livers)



Safety Assessment of ABT-207
The toxicological assessment of ABT-207 was done for both males and females in rodents and in non-human primates. Both rats and cynomolgus monkeys were treated once weekly for 14 weeks with ABT-207 at four different doses and kept in the recovery phase for 12 weeks. In the rats, an increase in serum iron and a decrease in UIBC for both males and females and a gender difference could be observed. The males were more sensitive during the dosing period in this study since a pronounced effect in serum iron and UIBC could be seen between 40 and 200 mg/kg/week dose. However, both sexes showed normalized blood parameters after the recovery period (Fig. 6a, c).Fig. 6 Serum iron and UIBC of SD rats and cynomolgus monkeys treated with 14 doses of ABT-207 once weekly followed by a 12-week recovery period. SD rats and cynomolgus monkeys were treated with ABT-207 at doses of 0, 2, 8, 40, and 200 mg/kg (rats) and 0, 2, 8, 40, and 160 mg/kg (cynomolgus monkeys) for 14 weeks and subsequently kept under recovery phase for 12 weeks. Total recovery of serum iron and UIBC was seen after 12 weeks for rats (a, c) and cynomolgus monkeys (b, d). Statistical analysis shows significant effect (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001) from one-way ANOVA conducting Dunnett’s post-hoc test with 0 mg/kg/week group (vehicle) as baseline. Data is displayed in mean and error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM)



The observation of the iron parameters in ABT-207-treated cynomolgus male and female monkeys during the dosing period was similar. An increase in serum iron and a decrease in UIBC level could be seen at doses of 40 and 160 mg/kg/week in male and female cynomolgus monkeys, and a total recovery could be seen after 12 weeks (Fig. 6b, d).

Evaluation of the PPB-stained tissue sections also revealed that the iron effect, present in mid- and high-dose groups, was not adverse and was partly reversible after the recovery phase (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Iron-restricted medical disorders caused by excessive hepcidin, e.g., in ACD, iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA), or anemia of chronic kidney disease, are lacking suitable therapeutic options, and the current treatment strategies are accompanied by undesired side effects (1). All current approaches targeting hepcidin and bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR) directly may have major drawbacks due to hepcidin’s high turnover rate and BMPR’s involvement in many other cellular processes (19,20).

ABT-207 and the affinity-matured h5F9-AM8 mAb are mAbs targeting repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) with specific binding affinity towards RGMa and RGMc, and this binding also inhibits the RGMc-BMP2/4/6 interaction. These antibodies differ in their binding affinity towards RGMa and RGMc (ABT-207 rat KD 59 nM and h5F9-AM8 rat KD 0.24 nM) (Supplementary Table 1). A cellular reporter gene assay, specific for RGMc-BMP2/4, showed that IC50 for these antibodies differed approximately 50-fold between ABT-207 (IC50 17 nM) and h5F9-AM8 (IC50 0.37 nM) (Kovac et al. submitted—under review). These data indicate that affinity maturation led to a more efficacious inhibition of the RGMc-BMP-driven effects. Since it is known that BMPs are deeply involved in iron metabolism pathway, we decided to investigate in vivo to which extent ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 are involved in iron regulation.

As ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 antibodies showed different efficacy in vitro, single-application studies were carried out for both antibodies. When we administrated 200 mg/kg ABT-207 or 20 mg/kg h5F9-AM8 to rats, we detected an increase in serum iron and a decrease in UIBC (Fig. 1a, b). With ABT-207, these differences were significant until week 3 post injection whereas treatment with h5F9-AM8 showed a higher magnitude and significantly longer-lasting effects up to six weeks. Liver hepcidin mRNA expression was significantly reduced for 8 weeks in ABT-207- and h5F9-AM8-treated animals; however, a more pronounced effect was seen for h5F9-AM8. Correlating to the data on mRNA level, the serum hepcidin protein concentration was suppressed significantly after ABT-207 application for 3 weeks and up to 6 weeks after h5F9-AM8 (Fig. 1c–f).

Since our antibodies bind to RGMc and block the RGMc-BMP interaction which induces downregulation of liver-derived hormone hepcidin, it is very likely that iron release through ferroportin is the intermediate step in this pathway. The data supports the abovementioned notion that these mAbs specifically act via the BMP-hepcidin-ferroportin pathway albeit with different efficacy. Xiao et al. reported that hepcidin has high turnover rate (approximately 2.3 min in cynomolgus monkeys) (11), but the binding of our antibodies to RGMc and not directly to hepcidin solved this issue. Due to the antibodies’ long half-lives in rats (7.2–11.7 days), hepcidin was successfully downregulated for several weeks and this negatively correlates with the serum iron levels. The fading antibody effect was only seen after several half-lives when the antibody concentration is extremely low.

In order to evaluate the dose response relationship for ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8, dose escalation studies were conducted in rats. Antibody concentrations measured in serum samples of all animals were dose related. In rats dosed with ABT-207, an increase in serum iron and a decrease in UIBC were seen at a dose of 60 mg/kg/week (NOEL = 10 mg/kg). On the other hand, in rats dosed with h5F9-AM8, these changes were already observed at a minimal dose of 0.2 mg/kg/week (NOEL = 0.02 mg/kg) (Fig. 3). For both antibodies, a dose response relationship could be established for the UIBC. ABT-207 had an IC50 of 12.74 mg/kg and h5F9-AM8’s IC50 was 0.15 mg/kg, which had approximately 80-fold difference for this parameter (Supplementary Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 4A).

With this result, we could establish a good correlation between the in vivo and in vitro data (Kovac et al. in preparation). Since both antibodies have comparable pharmacokinetic parameters, the differences in efficacy in vivo are most likely driven by the differences in their binding affinities.

In order to investigate the specificity of the antibody effect on hepcidin expression, we chose the affinity-maturated h5F9-AM8 antibody. A whole genome transcriptomic profiling (Affymetrix) experiment was conducted. There were a minimal number of global gene expression changes for the NOEL (0.02 mg/kg), mid dose (2 mg/kg) and the highest dose (20 mg/kg). The most downregulated gene in the dataset was hepcidin, and only minor modulations were apparent with respect to select BMPs and ferroportin (Slc40a1) (Fig. 5).

Based on this analysis, we conclude that h5F9-AM8 only induces iron effects and only minor perturbations on the liver. Potential toxicological consequences of excess iron may include production of free radicals and other reactive oxygen species. Gene expression signals indicate a minor induction of an oxidative stress response only at the 20 mg/kg dose, including increased GSTs and proteasome subunits. In order to quantify the dose response effect of h5F9-AM8, we analyzed hepcidin mRNA expression, serum hepcidin levels, liver iron deposition, and spleen iron content. Liver hepcidin mRNA expression and serum hepcidin level analyses revealed a closely related dose-dependent decrease for both parameters (Fig. 4). The IC50 for liver hepcidin was determined to be approximately 0.08 and 0.03 mg/kg for serum hepcidin (Supplementary Figure 3B-C).

Under some pathological conditions (hemochromatosis), low hepcidin levels result in increased serum iron, periportal iron accumulation in liver, and spleen iron depletion; we asked if this condition occurs due to the application of ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 as well. Single-application studies with these antibodies showed periportal liver iron deposition between week 1 and week 9 in animals treated with 200 mg/kg ABT-207 and between week 1 and week 12 (end of study) in animals treated with 20 mg/kg h5F9-AM8. We also observed reduction of iron load of macrophages in the spleen within this time frame (Fig. 2). The PPB-stained liver and spleen tissue sections were quantified with a semi-automated morphometric analysis (Supplementary Figure 2). This analysis supported the qualitative histological findings confirming the stronger effect of h5F9-AM8 in comparison to ABT-207. Also in the dose response studies, a dose-dependent iron accumulation in the liver and iron depletion in the spleen was observed.

In order to access possible toxicological findings and reversibility of the effects generated, we conducted 13-week (14 weekly injections of ABT-207) toxicology studies followed by a 12-week recovery period in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Besides the usual assessment of toxicology parameters, iron metabolism was monitored through serum iron, UIBC, and PPB staining (data not shown). Through the toxicology studies, we could demonstrate that rats were the more sensitive species (UIBC IC50 12.74 mg/kg/week) compared to the cynomolgus monkeys (UIBC IC50 34.73 mg/kg/week) (Supplementary Figure 4). The only finding induced by ABT-207 in these studies was a dose-dependent effect of ABT-207 on iron parameters which were assessed as non-adverse and showed reversibility for all serum parameters after the recovery phase.

In addition, all in vivo studies did not result in test item-related clinical signs, body weight changes, mortality, or any other adverse findings including morphological changes of all examined tissues. The antibody also had low immunogenic potential (very low evidence for the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)).

CONCLUSION
In summary, we showed that both ABT-207 and h5F9-AM8 downregulate liver hepcidin production which in consequence alters iron metabolism and disposition. Moreover, this intervention is highly specific since it fits to the RGMc-hepcidin-iron cascade (increase of serum iron, decrease in spleen iron, and liver iron accumulation). No adverse effects including low incidence of ADAs could be detected in all studies conducted so far (0.025% in rats and no incidence in cynomolgus monkeys), and all other serum effects (serum iron and UIBC) were reversible. Iron accumulation in liver was partially reversible. All these outcomes point to a specific intervention on a druggable target and open a new dimension in the treatment of hepcidin-related anemia. ABT-207 and in particular the h5F9-AM8 which acts as a specific and highly efficacious antibody with a relatively long half-life seem suitable for medical indications in which hepcidin upregulation plays a role. Further animal studies using these antibodies, within appropriate disease animal models, are performed and are described (Kovac et al. submitted—under review).

At the heart of IVIVC is deconvolution, the method of deriving an in vivo “dissolution profile” for comparison with in vitro dissolution data. IVIVCs are generally believed to be possible for highly permeable and highly soluble compounds with release/dissolution as the rate-limiting step. In this manuscript, we apply the traditional deconvolution methods, Wagner-Nelson and numerical deconvolution, to profiles simulated using a simplified small intestine absorption and transit model. Small intestinal transit, dissolution, and absorption rate constants are varied across a range of values approximately covering those observed in the literature. IVIVC plots and their corresponding correlation coefficients are analyzed for each combination of parameters to determine the applicability of the deconvolution methods under a range of rate-limiting conditions. For highly absorbed formulations, the correlation coefficients obtained during IVIVC are comparable for both methods and steadily decline with decreasing dissolution rate and increasing transit rate. The applicability of numerical deconvolution to IVIVC is not greatly affected by absorption rate, whereas the applicability of Wagner-Nelson falls when dissolution rate overcomes absorption rate and absorption becomes the rate-limiting step. The discrepancy between the expected and deconvolved input arises from the violation of a key assumption of deconvolution that the unknown input and unit impulse enter the system in the same location.

INTRODUCTION
In vitro-in vivo correlations (IVIVC) play an important role in the production and approval of drug products and formulations. Once an IVIVC is established for a set of formulations, then in vitro dissolution tests can be used in place of further bioequivalence studies in the production or modification of different formulations (1). Thus, IVIVCs play an important role in the industry, saving time, money, and unnecessary clinical trials. At the heart of IVIVC is deconvolution, the method of deriving an in vivo “dissolution profile” for point by point comparison with in vitro dissolution data in what is termed a “level A” IVIVC by the FDA (2).

Several methods of deconvolution have been used over the past 50 years in the field of pharmacokinetics. The traditional methods, Wagner-Nelson and Loo-Reigelman, appeared in the 1960s (3,4). These methods have been used extensively to determine the absorption kinetics following an oral administration, and Wagner-Nelson is still the most frequently used method in IVIVC. Numerical deconvolution emerged in the 1970s as an alternative method of calculating drug input rates (5) (whether it be the rate of absorption or rate of dissolution).

These deconvolution methods have been applied to the calculation of IVIVCs for a variety of compounds and formulations in the literature, but often, the assumptions underlying their applicability are not discussed in detail. It has been noted in the literature that IVIVCs are generally possible for high permeability compounds and for formulations where release/dissolution is the rate-limiting step, with dissolution still occurring within the time frame of intestinal transit (6), provided that there is a dissolution method that can effectively differentiate between different release characteristics. This manuscript will further challenge this general rule and intentionally push the boundaries to reveal where deconvolution can be safely used in IVIVC, and where it can be expected to fail.

We focus on the traditional deconvolution methods, Wagner-Nelson and numerical deconvolution, and their applicability under different rate-limiting conditions. We chose the former since it is the most widely used deconvolution method in IVIVC and the latter since it can be used to predict in vivo dissolution separately from absorption. The sensitivity of IVIVC with these methods to different rate-limiting conditions was tested on a simplified compartmental transit model. This was achieved by generating a number of simulations, each with a different combination of absorption, dissolution, and transit rates, applying the deconvolution methods to the resulting profiles and establishing an IVIVC for each case.

METHODS
A simplified absorption and transit model was used to test the effects of changing dissolution, absorption, and transit rates on the applicability of two deconvolution methods in establishing IVIVCs. Intestinal transit, dissolution, and absorption rates were varied across physiologically meaningful ranges obtained from the literature. For each combination of parameters, the profiles following administration of an oral solution and an immediate release formulation were simulated. Wagner-Nelson and numerical deconvolution were applied to obtain the deconvolved absorption profiles. These absorption profiles were plotted against the respective fraction dissolved curves representing the in vitro dissolution curves that would be used to establish an IVIVC. The corresponding correlation coefficients for each in vitro fraction dissolved vs. in vivo fraction absorbed plot were calculated in order to gauge the effect of transit, dissolution, and absorption rates on the interpretation of deconvolution. Following the analysis of the applicability of these methods to IVIVC in different situations, we analytically deconvolved absorption models of smaller size to obtain closed form solutions to the deconvolved input so that the reasons for the discrepancies between the deconvolution methods and the simulated in vitro dissolution profile could be determined. The equations associated with Wagner-Nelson and numerical deconvolution used in this investigation are provided in the Appendix.

TEST MODEL
Model Structure
In this study, we tested deconvolution on a series of simplified absorption and transit models, based on the traditional compartmental transit model (i.e., Yu et al. 1996) (7). The simplified model used here is comprised of seven intestinal segments, each with solid and dissolved compartments (see Fig. 1). An oral dosage starts in Asol,1 (or Adis,1 for an oral solution). The solid drug in each segment, Asol,1, can either transition to the next segment, Asol,i + 1, at a rate of, kT ⋅ Asol,i or dissolve according to the rate kD ⋅ Asol,i and thus enter Adis,i. From Adis,i, the dissolved drug can be absorbed into the systemic circulation at a rate of ka ⋅ Adis,i. Drug is eliminated from the central compartment with rate ke ⋅ Acentral. The system of differential equations describing this model is presented below.Fig. 1 Scheme for a 7 compartment absorption and transit test model. A

For simplicity during our analysis, we assumed that dissolution followed a first order process with rate constant kD and that this rate constant was the same for each compartment. These assumptions are not completely representative of the true physiology since the increasing pH gradient along the intestinal tract can affect the solubility and therefore the dissolution rate of formulations. In addition, the first order rate constant for absorption, ka, was assumed the same in each compartment. However, varied surface area of the intestinal segments, and the varied surface area of villi and microvilli along the intestinal tract (8) suggest this is also an oversimplification. Making these assumptions allowed for clear analysis of the effect of changing the dissolution and absorption rates and their impact on the interpretation of the deconvolved input. The values for these parameters and the remaining system parameters are discussed in the following section.

Parameter Values
The effects of changing transit rate, dissolution rate, and absorption rates on the results of deconvolution were analyzed. The 7 compartment intestinal transit model was solved under various scenarios, each with a different set of values for these parameters, which were selected according to a range of typical values approximately covering those observed in the literature (7,9–11). Five values were selected for each of the transit, dissolution, and mean absorption rates (see Fig. 2). Simulations using the 7 compartment model were run with each combination of parameters, obtaining a set of 5 × 5 × 5 simulations (totaling 125 simulations; see Appendix Fig. 8 for the simulated plasma concentration time profiles).Fig. 2 Parameter values used for analysis of the effects of intestinal transit, dissolution, and absorption (k

D, and k
a, respectively) on the applicability of the traditional deconvolution methods in IVIVC. Parameter values were selected to approximately cover those observed in the literature (7,9). Simulations using the 7 compartment intestinal model were run with each combination of parameters, obtaining a set of 5 × 5 × 5 simulations



A range of transit rates were calculated based on total small intestinal transit times of 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 min, which approximately covers the range of transit times described in Yu 1996 (mean 200 min, minimum 30, maximum 570) (7). The total small intestinal transit rate constants from this range of transit times are 1.2, 0.6, 0.3, 0.15, and 0.75 h−1. Each simulation assumed one of these transit rates for the entire small intestine, which was adjusted accordingly for seven compartments, i.e., individual compartment transit rate constants of 8.4, 4.2, 2.1, 1.05, and 0.525 h−1.

A range of dissolution rates were calculated based on 96% dissolved after 24, 12, 6, 3, and 1.5 h. Assuming first order dissolution, this gives dissolution rate constants of approximately 0.135, 0.27, 0.54, 1.08, and 2.16 h−1.

A range of absorption rates were calculated based on effective permeability (Peff) values of 0.03 × 10−4, 0.12 × 10−4, 0.48 × 10−4, 1.92 × 10−4, and 7.68 × 10−4 cm/s which approximately cover the range of Peffs reported in Lennernas (2014) (minimum 0.03 × 10−4, maximum 8.7 × 10−4 cm/s) (9). Absorption rates were then calculated as 2 × Peff/r with a radius (r) of 1.75 cm (9) resulting in ka values of approximately 0.0125, 0.05, 0.2, 0.8, and 3.2 h−1.

Median values for volume of distribution and elimination rate constants were determined from a database of compounds analyzed in the PhRMA CPCDC initiative of 2011 (10,11). The volume of the central compartment was taken to be 120 L, which is approximately the median of the PhRMA CPCDC initiative compounds reported in Jones 2011 (10) assuming a body weight of 70 kg. The elimination rate constant was taken to be 0.2 h−1, the median value of clearance divided by volume of distribution, calculated from the range of clearance values of the PhRMA CPCDC initiative reported in Ring 2011 (11) and the corresponding volumes of distribution for the same compound set reported in Jones 2011 (10).

After the sensitivity analysis, we analyzed the interpretation of the deconvolved output using model simulations evaluated with the mid-range values for intestinal transit rate (kT of 2.1 h−1 for all seven compartments) and dissolution (kD of 0.54 h−1). For the absorption rate, we took a typical value for a highly permeable compound since IVIVC is considered to be more identifiable for highly permeable compounds (6). In addition to the 7 compartmental transit model described above, 2 and 1 compartment transit models were also analyzed. For these models, transit rates were adjusted accordingly. For the parameter values used during the analysis of models of various dimensions, see Table I.Table I Parameter Values Used for Analysis of the Intestinal Models of Various Dimensions

Simulation Conditions
For each parameter set, the test model was used to simulate plasma concentration profiles following administration of immediate release formulation and oral solution. The oral solution was simulated using initial condition of the total dose in the first dissolved compartment (Adis,1) and zero elsewhere. The immediate release formulation was simulated using an initial condition of the total dose in the first solid compartment (Asol,1) and zero elsewhere. The system of differential equations was solved in Matlab version R2013a (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts) using the built-in ordinary differential equations solver ode45. The amount of drug in the central compartment, Acentral, was divided by VD to obtain the simulated plasma concentration profiles.

DECONVOLUTION METHODS AND IVIVC PROCEDURE
Wagner-Nelson was applied to the simulated oral formulation concentration profiles, and numerical deconvolution was applied to the oral formulation profile, using the oral solution profile as the unit impulse response (UIR) (see Appendix for more details on the application of these methods). For the elimination rate constant which is needed in the calculation of fraction absorbed (fa) via Wagner-Nelson, we used the actual value of ke from the simulations, in order to avoid the possibility of flip-flop kinetics that can occur when ka or kD is the rate-limiting step. This simulates the ideal scenario in which one had the perfect intravenous bolus UIR. During numerical deconvolution, the deconvolved input for the oral formulation was assumed to take the form of a continuous piecewise quadratic with continuous first derivative (12).

Note that Wagner-Nelson relies solely upon observed drug concentrations in the central compartment, and so the result reflects all processes leading up to systemic circulation, including absorption as well as dissolution. In contrast, using an oral solution as the UIR in numerical deconvolution provides a distinction between the systemic appearance of the oral solution and the other dosage form. This difference is considered to represent in vivo dissolution, assuming that all processes associated with absorption of the solid formulation and oral solution are identical. Potential errors in and consequences of this assumption are discussed later in this paper.

Predicted in vivo fraction of drug absorbed and dissolved over time obtained through deconvolution using the Wagner-Nelson and numerical deconvolution methods, respectively, were plotted against the corresponding simulated in vitro dissolution profiles. The simulated in vitro dissolution profiles were assumed to be from an ideal in vitro experiment, in which the same first order kinetics were observed as those that occurred within the simulated in vivo system. The reason for assuming this ideal situation was to identify any discrepancy between the deconvolution methods and the dissolution profiles that they are intended to represent. Correlation coefficients were obtained for each in vitro fraction dissolved vs. in vivo fraction absorbed/dissolved plot, for each combination of parameters simulated, and each of the two deconvolution methods tested. These correlation coefficients were analyzed for trends across the different parameter values and deconvolution methods. In order for the correlation coefficients to have practical meaning, they were calculated over the time points 1, 5, 15, 30, and 45 min, and 1, 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 h, simulating realistic sampling times.

RESULTS
Sensitivity Analysis: Impact of Intestinal Transit, Dissolution, and Permeability on the Applicability of Deconvolution Methods During IVIVC
Figure 3 illustrates representative profiles of % absorbed (Wagner-Nelson) or dissolved (numerical deconvolution) in vivo vs. % dissolved in vitro with various combinations of values for the rate parameters. For the ideal case, with a highly absorbed and rapidly dissolved formulation, both Wagner-Nelson and numerical deconvolution perform comparably well, with R-squared values above 0.9 (Fig. 3, top left panel). Decreasing the dissolution rate introduces a discrepancy between the deconvolved inputs and the dissolution profile (Fig. 3, top right panel). However, IVIVC results in reasonable correlations with R-square values again above 0.9 for both methods. Decreasing ka reveals the difference between the deconvolution methods during IVIVC. The numerically deconvolved profile more closely matches the simulated in vitro dissolution profile, while the fraction absorbed obtained with Wagner-Nelson is greatly affected by the decreased ka (Fig. 3, bottom left panel). Adjusting for fraction absorbed does not resolve this discrepancy for the Wagner-Nelson method (R-squared value below 0.7), whereas the R-squared value for numerical deconvolution remains above 0.9. Figure 3, bottom right panel, displays the combined effect of decreasing both ka and kD. Interestingly, the R-squared values for both the numerical deconvolution and Wagner-Nelson methods are above 0.9, despite the noticeable decrease in overall fraction absorbed.Fig. 3 Plotted are four representative simulated in vivo deconvolved dissolution and absorption over time profiles obtained using numerical deconvolution (dashed green curves) and Wagner-Nelson (dot-dashed red curves) for different combinations of parameters, plotted against the theoretical in vitro dissolution profile (solid blue curves). Subpanels display the respective % dissolved in vitro vs. % dissolved in vivo plots for numerical deconvolution (dashed green curves) and % dissolved in vitro vs. % absorbed in vivo plots for Wagner-Nelson (dot-dashed red curves) beach of the two deconvolution methods, along with the associated regression lines (solid blue curves) and their R-squared values.

Figure 4 plots the correlation coefficients for the IVIVCs obtained using the Wagner-Nelson (top panels) and numerical deconvolution (bottom panels) methods, varying kD, ka and kT. It is clear from this figure that for numerical deconvolution, the highest correlation can be seen when kD and ka are highest, and kT is the lowest (see the rightmost panel, topmost curve, leftmost point). In each panel, the correlation increases with decreasing kT (following each graph from right to left), and the correlation increases with increasing kD (moving from the bottommost to the topmost curve within each of the panels). Increasing kD effectively decreases the transit rate within the solid compartments, decreasing the effect of transit on the numerically deconvolved input. ka has little impact on the correlation obtained with numerical deconvolution.Fig. 4 Correlation coefficients (R) for IVIVCs obtained using Wagner-Nelson (top panels) and numerical deconvolution (bottom panels), varying the rates for dissolution, absorption, and transit. Within each panel, transit rate constants increase from 0.525 on the left to 8.4 h−1 on the right and dissolution rate constants increase from 0.135 (blue circles) to 2.16 h−1 (magenta diamonds). Each panel represents a different absorption rate constant, increasing from 0.0125 in the leftmost panel, to 3.2 h−1 in the rightmost panel




In contrast, ka has a great impact on the correlations obtained for the Wagner-Nelson method. For the highest ka, the relationship between the effects of transit and dissolution on the correlation mirrors that of numerical deconvolution. For low kT, dissolution rate has little impact on the correlation, while for high kT, the higher the dissolution the better the correlation. As ka is decreased, an interesting relationship between transit rate and dissolution rate is revealed. For decreasing values of kT (left of each panel), the higher values of kD result in lower correlations, and this effect is steadily magnified as ka decreases (from the rightmost to the leftmost panel). Following the panels from left to right, the correlation obtained for middle range values of kT and kD increases with increasing ka. This observation is in agreement with previous statements that IVIVC is more likely to be possible for highly permeable compounds.

Analytical Deconvolution of Simplified Absorption Models: What is Numerical Deconvolution Really Giving Us?
In the previous section, we illustrated that the performance of IVIVC using Wagner-Nelson is highly impacted by absorption rate, while that using numerical deconvolution is relatively stable across different absorption rates, being affected more by dissolution and transit rates. The reason for this difference in the sensitivity to absorption rate is clear and should be expected based on what each method is measuring. The Wagner-Nelson method provides an estimate of amount of drug entering the systemic circulation, while numerical deconvolution (with an oral solution as the unit impulse response (UIR)) provides an estimate of amount of drug that has entered a dissolved state. Numerical deconvolution is still noticeably affected by transit and dissolution rates, and in this section, we will explore the reasons, looking at models with fewer transit compartments, and analytically deconvolving these model simulations.

The previous section compared the deconvolved fraction absorbed over time with a theoretical in vitro dissolution profile of the form (Dose1−e−kDt), the rate of which is kDe−kDt. However, this is not exactly the rate by which the oral formulation enters the point of application of the oral solution, which was the assumption required to use the oral solution as the UIR. Thus, we observed the differences between the simulated in vitro dissolution profile and the numerically deconvolved absorption profile.

As an alternative, it may be reasonable for one to expect the deconvolved input to be that which enters the system in the same location as the oral solution, the first dissolved compartment, namely kD ⋅ Asol,1(t). However, this assumption neglects the fact that the oral formulation may travel from the first solid compartment to the next before dissolving. Keeping this in mind, another possibly more reasonable expectation for the deconvolved input may be ∑7ikD ⋅ Asol,i(t), the sum of all of the rates by which the oral formulation enters a dissolved state. It may be hard to imagine, but this expectation is not correct either. Figure 5 illustrates the difference. The first expectation kD ⋅ Asol,1(t) drastically underpredicts, while the second ∑i7kD ⋅ Asol,i(t) overpredicts the deconvolved input. However, the second expectation is a vast improvement over the theoretical dissolution rate, kDe−kDt.Fig. 5 The panel on the left compares the numerically deconvolved input (green dashed curve) with the theoretical in vitro dissolution rate kDe−kDt (solid blue curve), and the “reasonably expected” inputs k

These can be thought of as the respective in vivo absorption/dissolution profiles which would be used to establish an IVIVC



Applying the same analysis to an intestinal transit model with only one solid and one dissolved compartment reveals that the reasonably expected input, kD ⋅ Asol,1(t), and the numerically deconvolved input match exactly (Fig. 6, top panels). Adding just one transit compartment to the model introduces a discrepancy between the expected and observed numerically deconvolved input (Fig. 6, bottom panels). To understand how the transit compartment affects the deconvolved input, we derived an analytical expression for the deconvolved input for the two compartment transit model.Fig. 6

Removing intestinal transit from the model results in the numerically deconvolved input matching the “expected” input. Bottom left: comparison of the analytically derived input (magenta x marked curve) with the numerically deconvolved input (green dashed curve) and the “reasonably expected” inputs (red dot-dashed and cyan dotted curves) for the two compartmental absorption and transit model (schematic diagram on the right). The analytically derived input matches the numerically deconvolved input; thus, the analytical solution can be analyzed to determine why the deconvolved input deviates from the expected input. The middle panels represent the integral over time of the input profiles, and can be considered as the respective in vivo absorption/dissolution profiles



The two compartment transit model can be solved analytically, and the deconvolved input can be determined using the properties of the Laplace transform. The analytical solution to the two compartment transit model for the oral formulation (Acentral,form(t)) in terms of that for the oral solution (Acentral,soln(t)) is Acentral,formt=kDAsol,1t*Acentral,solnt+kDAsol,2t*kae−kT+kat*e−ket where * is the convolution operator. This expression can be easily related to the schematic diagram for the model (see Fig. 6), following the two routes by which the drug may dissolve: (1) The drug may enter the first dissolution compartment giving the first term in the above expression, and (2) the drug may transit to the second solid compartment and then to the second dissolution compartment giving the second term.

Deconvolving the oral solution from the first term in this expression is straightforward, giving kDAsol,1(t). Deconvolving the second term is more complex, the details of which we will omit here. The resulting analytically derived input for the two compartment transit model is It=kDAsol,1t+kDAsol,2t−kTe−2kT+kat*kDAsol,2t. 

Figure 6, bottom panels, plot the analytically derived input against the numerically deconvolved input, verifying that the numerical deconvolution is in agreement with the analytically derived input.

Now that we have a closed form for the deconvolved input, we can see how the transit of the solid dosage form has an impact on the form for the deconvolved input. The significance of this will depend on the magnitude of the transit rate compared to dissolution and absorption. For highly soluble and highly permeable compounds, transit will have little impact on the interpretation of the deconvolved input. For poorly soluble compounds, transit will have more of an impact. This is in agreement with the results of the previous section, where the impact of transit rate on IVIVC with numerical deconvolution was magnified for slower dissolution rates (Fig. 4b).

DISCUSSION
Supposing it was possible to perform the perfect in vitro experiment that would exactly match the in vivo dissolution kinetics, we might assume the widely accepted deconvolution methods would be able to obtain a reasonable IVIVC. Plotting the first order dissolution curve using the simulated in vivo first order rate constant gives us this theoretically perfect in vitro dissolution profile. Plotting this simulated in vitro dissolution profile against the dissolution/absorption profile deconvolved from the simulated in vivo profiles, one can determine whether an IVIVC can be established.

The sensitivity analysis we performed offers a perspective on the rate-limiting steps involved during IVIVC. For the Wagner-Nelson method, rate-limiting transit reveals the importance of the relationship between absorption and dissolution. As ka decreases, higher kD gives poorer IVIVC which is in agreement with the idea that IVIVC is likely to be possible for high permeability, dissolution rate-limited formulations. However, this interaction is not observed for numerical deconvolution using an oral solution as the UIR. Numerical deconvolution gives very consistent results across the range of absorption rates, regardless of whether or not dissolution is the rate limiting step. Dissolution rate does however play a role in the applicability of numerical deconvolution to IVIVC when dissolution occurs outside of the intestinal transit window. In this case, IVIVC is more likely possible when intestinal transit is the rate-limiting step.

Though the simulated in vitro dissolution profile and the simulated in vivo dissolution incorporated into the model follow the exact same kinetics, the application of deconvolution does not obtain a reasonable IVIVC in every situation. The reason for this discrepancy is in the underlying assumptions required to apply deconvolution. Recall that there are two major assumptions in the derivation of numerical deconvolution. The first is that the system is linear, i.e., dose independent. This first assumption is not violated as all of the expressions in the test problem are linear in the state variables. The second is that the unknown input and the UIR enter the system in the same location. This is where the violation occurs.

It is clear that Wagner-Nelson is estimating the input in a location different to that where dissolution occurs since it is providing an estimate of the amount entering the systemic circulation, following both dissolution and permeation. It may not be obvious that this assumption is also violated for numerical deconvolution using the oral solution as the UIR. The transit of solid drug before dissolution is where the violation occurs.

In fact, when intestinal transit was removed from the system, and the intestinal compartments were replaced with one compartment each for the solid and dissolved drug, the deconvolved input then had the expected form of kD ⋅ Asol,1(t). Including intestinal transit of the solid compartment introduces a complexity into the model so that the deconvolved input no longer has the “reasonably expected” form.

The underperformance of Wagner-Nelson for low permeability compounds should be expected based on the fact that it is measuring the in vivo fraction absorbed, not the fraction dissolved. The relative stability of numerical deconvolution in response to a wide range of absorption rates should also be expected since using an IR solution as the UIR measures the in vivo fraction dissolved. Despite this fact, Wagner-Nelson is still the method of choice in the literature. In a literature search of journal articles in 2013 in which dissolution IVIVIC was performed, Wagner-Nelson was the most frequently applied method. Of the 27 articles identified in the search, 15 applied Wagner-Nelson (e.g., 13–15), while only 4 applied numerical deconvolution (e.g., 16). The remaining either applied a different method to obtain a level A IVIVC (e.g., a mechanistic model) or did not attempt a level A IVIVC at all. Considering the class of compounds that were investigated, it is perhaps not surprising that Wagner-Nelson was generally found to be sufficient. BCS class could be identified for 13 of the 27 publications examined, and all but one of these fell into BCS class 1 or 2, indicating that they were high permeability compounds. The remaining compound was of BCS class 3, and in that investigation, a level A IVIVC was not attempted (17). The absence of level A IVIVCs in the literature for these classes of compounds might reflect on the ability (or inability) to establish such IVIVCs, as unsuccessful IVIVCs tend not to be published. Since Wagner-Nelson, as the predominant method applied in the literature, performs poorly under absorption limited conditions, it would be interesting to see if a more widespread adoption of numerical deconvolution resulted in more successful IVIVCs for class 3 and 4.

While numerical deconvolution seemed to perform consistently well across the different scenarios, this performance can be dependent upon the accuracy of the numerical method applied. In the previous section, we noted that for a smaller test problem, our numerically deconvolved input exactly matched the analytically derived input (Fig. 6b). This may not be representative of the practical application of numerical deconvolution, which can be highly sensitive to noisy data, and results can vary depending on the prescribed form for the unknown input function. So in practice, numerical deconvolution may also have its limitations.

The simplicity of our test model and the range of parameter values selected may also indicate some limitations to our analysis, as some of the simulated scenarios may not have practical significance. For example, IVIVC is mainly applied to modified release formulations which often target the colon as the site of absorption, while the test model only included the small intestine. Several of the simulated combinations may result in a slower dissolution rate than could be realistically simulated with this test model. For the simulations involving the middle kT value, the residence time was 3.33 h, and a formulation that would ensure 80% dissolution in this time frame would need a kD greater than approximately 0.483 h−1. For the longest simulated residence time of 13.3 h, kD would need to be greater than 0.121 h−1, and for the shortest time of 0.833 h, kD would need to be greater than 1.93 h−1. In this range, numerical deconvolution performs very well, producing correlation coefficients consistently above 0.9.

However, the simplicity of our test model may also underestimate the disparity between in vitro dissolution tests and the simulated in vivo environment since the simulations have not taken into account that dissolution may vary with pH, which varies along the intestinal tract, and that absorption may vary with surface area of the different intestinal segments. Additionally, intestinal absorption may create sink conditions in vivo which can increase the in vivo release/dissolution rate.

Experimentalists have acknowledged the discrepancy between in vitro dissolution testing and the in vivo intestinal environment. For example, some have introduced a permeability compartment into their in vitro dissolution methods (18), acknowledging the effect of absorption on dissolution testing. Other examples include a modified USP 2 apparatus with a built-in pH gradient to account for pH-dependent solubility of poorly soluble basic drugs (19), or a multi-compartment stomach-duodenum model to simulate the dynamic conditions brought on by transport from the stomach to the duodenum as well as pH-dependent solubility (20). Taking things even further are in vitro digestion models with compartments for each of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, with lipases and acids incorporated in the stomach and pancreatic juices and bile in a duodenal compartment, among other simulated physiological attributes (21). However, these in vitro methods may be difficult to translate to the in vivo situation, with the scaling of in vitro compartment volumes up to physiological volumes, the transits between the in vitro compartments to physiological transit times, and the effect of absorption on dissolution kinetics.

Instead of creating an all encompassing in vitro system, physiologically based in silico models (e.g., GastroPlus™, PK-Sim®, and SimCYP®) have gone a different route by taking separate dissolution and absorption measurements in vitro and physiological parameters obtained in vivo and combining them into one dynamic model within the in silico environment. For example, a solubility model can be fit to data obtained at a range of pH, Caco-2 permeability can be scaled to in vivo permeability, and these properties and more can be incorporated into an in silico model which accounts for the varied intestinal environment with the transition through different pH values, surface area to volume ratios, all with the appropriate transit times (22). These models have been used recently in the establishment of IVIVCs, among other applications. For example, GastroPlus™ proved useful in the case of a manufacturing site change for a low solubility compound that dissolved rapidly in the stomach, with two formulations showing similarity in dissolution at pH 2, however failing to show similarity at higher pH (23). In another application of physiologically based IVIVC, SimCYP® was useful in separately accounting for intestinal and hepatic first pass metabolism during IVIVC, which clouded the in vivo dissolution profile obtained with traditional deconvolution methods (24). However, these in silico models also have their challenges with the multitude of in vitro and in vivo data required to build and validate them (GastroPlus™: Simulations Plus, Inc, Lancaster, CA http://www.simulations-plus.com, PK-Sim®: Bayer Technology Services, Leverkusen, Germany, http://www.systems-biology.com/products/pk-sim.html, SimCYP®: Simcyp Ltd, Sheffield, UK, http://www.simcyp.com).

With experimentalists pushing the boundary of in vitro dissolution and absorption systems, and modellers broadening the scope of in silico models, it is clear that deconvolution in IVIVC does not exist in isolation. The limitations and boundaries of applicability for deconvolution that have been discussed here may well be overcome with the right choice of in vitro experiment or in silico model.

CONCLUSION
The performance of both the Wagner-Nelson and numerical deconvolution methods during IVIVC is comparable for highly absorbed formulations, steadily declining with decreasing dissolution rate and increasing transit rate. The applicability of numerical deconvolution to IVIVC is not greatly affected by absorption rate, whereas the performance of Wagner-Nelson declines when absorption is the rate-limiting step. The theory of deconvolution relies on the underlying assumption that the unknown input and unit impulse enter the system in the same location, which is violated for slow release formulations. In order to broaden the scope of IVIVC, we must bridge the gap between in vitro dissolution and in vivo response, pushing the in vitro and in silico closer to in vivo conditions.

APPENDIX
Linear Systems Theory
The concept of deconvolution comes out of the theory of linear time invariant systems. Deconvolution is the process of determining an unknown input rate into a system given knowledge of the response to this input, and some additional information about how the system behaves. This additional information is the response of the system to a unit impulse rate that is an impulse rate function, e.g., δ(t), with area under the curve equal to unity. Since the input into the system represents a rate, the area under the curve of an input rate is the total amount entering the system with this input. The unit impulse can be thought of as a very rapid injection of unit dose into the system. The response to the unit impulse is called the unit impulse response (UIR) (25); here we will use F(t) to denote this response.

An arbitrary input I(t) can be approximated as a sum of impulses I(τ)δ(t − τ), centered at time τ, with magnitude I(τ), i.e., It≈∑τIτδt−τdτ. 

Assuming the system is linear and time invariant, the laws of superposition allow us to say that the response to a sum of impulses is equal to the sum of the responses to the individual impulses. Thus, the response, Y(t), to an arbitrary input I(t), can be approximated as a sum of unit impulse responses F(t − τ), centered at time τ with magnitude I(τ), i.e., Yt≈∑τIτFt−τdτ. 

Taking the limit of this approximation as the width of the impulses goes to zero, we have an integral expression for Y(t): Yt=∫0tIτFt−τdτ. 

This integral expression is called a convolution, and is sometimes expressed using the symbol *, i.e., It*Ft:=∫0tIτFt−τdτ. 

For a graphical interpretation of the above formulation, see Fig. 7.Fig. 7 The response Y(t) of a linear time invariant system  to an arbitrary input I(t) can be approximated as the sum of responses to impulse functions δ(t − τ) of magnitude I(τ), for τ up to time t




If two of the three functions, Y(t), I(t), F(t), are known, then the third is uniquely defined, and can be determined. Here, we focus on the situation in which the UIR, F(t) and the response Y(t) to an unknown input I(t) are known, and the unknown input I(t) is to be determined. The process of determining an unknown input provided its response and the UIR are known is called deconvolution. In IVIVC of an oral formulation, the UIR can be the plasma concentration profile following an IV bolus dose or following an immediate release formulation or solution, and the unknown input is the rate of in vivo absorption/dissolution. Integrating the input over time will give the cumulative amount absorbed or dissolved, which can then be used along with the in vitro dissolution profile to establish an IVIVC.Fig. 8 Typical plasma concentration vs time profiles obtained during the simulations. Each panel represents a different pairing of kT and ka value, with ka increasing from the leftmost to rightmost panel and kT increasing from the bottom- to top-most panel. Within each panel are concentration profiles following administration of an IV bolus dose (blue solid curves), an IR solution (green dashed curves), and oral formulation with the five different values for kD (red dot-dashed curves)



Numerical Deconvolution
Numerical deconvolution utilizes linear systems theory, applying a minimization process directly to the convolution integral to obtain the unknown input. A functional form for the input I(t) is assumed; the parameters of which can be obtained by fitting the convolved response to observed data. This optimization problem is usually performed by minimizing the sum of square residuals (SSR) between the estimated (convolved) and observed responses (25,26). Yestt=∫0tIestτFt−τdτSSR=∑iYobsti−Yestti2 

Numerical deconvolution is a model invariant method, making no assumption about the mathematical form for the system, i.e., it does not assume first order kinetics for elimination, or any compartmental model, etc. Numerical deconvolution is also more flexible in the assumptions for the absorption, the flexibility of which depends on the parameterized form for the input function. When the general behavior of the absorption kinetics is known a priori, this can help with the choice of the form for the input function, e.g., a first order absorption function can be assumed if first order absorption is expected. However, a more general input function may be selected for situations where the absorption behavior is not well characterized ahead of time, or when dealing with some of the nonstandard formulations. Gamel et al. (12) examined several options for the input function, including a single polynomial fit, a continuous piecewise linear function, and a continuous piecewise quadratic with continuous first derivative. Numerical deconvolution is one of the more stable methods of deconvolution (12), especially when it comes to noisy data (5), much more stable than the Fourier transform method for example.

Wagner-Nelson
The Wagner-Nelson method gives an estimate of the percent of drug absorbed as a function of time. The percent of drug absorbed at time t is equal to the amount absorbed up to time t, divided by the total amount eventually absorbed. The amount of drug that has been absorbed up to time t can be expressed as the amount in the body at time t plus the amount that has been eliminated up to that time point. Assuming first order kinetics, we have %absorbed=AtA∞×100=At+k∫τ=0tAτdτk∫τ=0∞Aτdτ×100 

Where A(t) is the amount of drug in the system at time t and k is the first order elimination rate constant (4). If a fixed volume of distribution is assumed, amount can be replaced with concentration C(t). %absorbed=Ct+k∫τ=0tCτdτk∫τ=0∞Cτdτ×100 

Ideally, the elimination rate constant should be estimated by fitting a one compartment model to IV plasma data. In practice, many people will use the elimination rate constant obtained from a compartmental model fit to oral data. This practice is not always adequate considering the well-known phenomenon of flip-flop kinetics which occurs when absorption is the rate-limiting step. Absorption will be the rate-limiting step for many modified release formulations, i.e., for extended or delayed release formulations which are designed to slow the absorption rate. Absorption will also be rate-limiting for poorly permeable compounds. Thus, estimating the systemic elimination rate constant from a modified release profile, or any oral profile for a poorly absorbed compound, should be avoided.

A proposed explanation is that invariably PBPK models report the concentration in the central venous compartment, rather than the site where the samples are drawn. The purpose of this study was to identify and validate potential corrective models based on anatomy and physiology governing the blood supply at the site of sampling and incorporate them into a PBPK platform. Four models were developed and scrutinised for their corrective potential. All assumed the peripheral sampling site concentration could be described by contributions from surrounding tissues and utilised tissue-specific concentration-time profiles reported from the full-PBPK model within the Simcyp Simulator. Predicted concentrations for the peripheral site were compared to the observed Cmax. The models results were compared to clinical data for 15 studies over seven compounds (alprazolam, imipramine, metoprolol, midazolam, omeprazole, rosiglitazone and theophylline). The final model utilised tissue concentrations from adipose, skin, muscle and a contribution from artery. Predicted Cmax values considering the central venous compartment can over-predict the observed values up to 10-fold whereas the new sampling site predictions were within 2-fold of observed values. The model was particularly relevant for studies where traditional PBPK models over-predict early time point concentrations. A successful corrective model for Cmax prediction has been developed, subject to further validation. These models can be enrolled as built-up modules into PBPK platforms and potentially account for factors that may affect the initial mixing of the blood at the site of sampling.

INTRODUCTION
It has been observed that physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models can often report over-predicted maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) values compared to in vivo data. This is most obvious when administration is via the intravenous (i.v.) route over a short time period, for example, a fast infusion or bolus. It is suggested that this discrepancy, apart from practical limitations in drawing blood samples immediately after giving an i.v. dose, may be because PBPK models traditionally report the concentration in the central venous compartment, i.e. the “pooled venous return”, whereas in clinical studies, sampling is usually taken from a peripheral vein in the arm due to ethical and logistical considerations (1). These two sites may not have the same concentrations, particularly at early time points where distribution throughout the body tissues is ongoing, and equilibration has not occurred.

With PBPK models increasingly used in assessments of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicology, this is an issue that cannot be dismissed. PBPK approaches have been used in toxicology for the development of exposure limits (1) and to obtain predicted Cmax values to be utilised in the assessment of potential adverse effects (2). These models are also increasingly used in pharmaceutical regulatory submissions (3–6). For modelling of pharmacodynamics, if arterial concentrations are considered to drive an observed effect, it is important to understand how this concentration relates to that observed from the clinical venous sampling. It is clearly critical to know what is being reported from PBPK models and how the underlying models relate to the in vivo situation.

The idea that over-prediction of Cmax, when reporting from the central venous compartment, is indicative of physiological differences between the central venous compartment and the peripheral sampling site is not new and not only theoretical; evidence to support the concept of local differences in distribution, mixing and concentration between potential sampling sites in vivo has been published. Concentration differences can be observed between arterial and venous sampling and can also be dependent on the location of the specific vessels within the body as reviewed by Chiou (7, 8) as early as 1989. This review highlighted numerous examples where the choice of sampling site can lead to significant differences in the observed concentrations, both in human and in animal studies. The author also highlighted that utilising the “wrong” observed concentration could have potentially serious implications.

Differences between the arterial and venous concentrations and potential models for inter-conversion of reported data have been described by a number of investigators (9–14). Many of these publications focus on the implications of these concentration differences for modelling of pharmacodynamics, and these models are generally empirical or compartmental in structure and are not easily applied to PBPK models. In addition, some published models require prior knowledge of in vivo concentration-time or pharmacokinetic data, and/or parameter fitting, meaning that they could not be applied in a predictive scenario such as the estimation of first-in-man pharmacokinetics. A physiologically based recirculatory model for fentanyl was constructed and presented by Upton et al. (15). However, a number of the parameters were determined using prior knowledge of the compound distribution and hence are not applicable in a generic “bottom-up” PBPK model. Levitt (16) provides the most pragmatic method to address the problem, by using an approach of creating a PBPK model for the arm to describe a peripheral sampling site. This model was developed to describe and predict the kinetics of organic solvents and may not be relevant for a wider variety of pharmaceutical compounds; although it does provide a useful starting point for model development.

The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a potential corrective model to describe the Cmax at a peripheral sampling site, utilising the full PBPK model within the Simcyp population-based Simulator. A number of different options were assessed and compared to observed in vivo data. The model giving the best performance was selected for further validation and future development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Model Definitions
The base model in this study follows the assumption that the tissues surrounding a peripheral sampling site contribute, to varying degrees, to the observed venous concentration at that location. A similar approach was suggested by Levitt (16), where “flow fractions” were used to describe the contribution of each tissue to the final overall concentration at the sampling site. These flow fractions were determined using a fitting approach where the values were adjusted within the PBPK model to recover the observed experimental data. The model described herein utilises the tissue concentration profiles predicted by the Simcyp Simulator full PBPK model (17), which allows simulation of tissue concentration data for all organs incorporated within the model. These tissue profiles, which are commonly reported with respect to blood, in combination with the tissue:plasma partition coefficient (Kps), can be used to calculate the emergent concentrations which leave the tissues. These can then be used in combination with drug data and the defined fractions to describe an overall concentration-time profile at a peripheral sampling site where a corrected Cmax value can be observed. The fractions determined by Levitt (16) provided the initial estimates that were incorporated in the model for validation.

The tissue concentrations selected for incorporation in the model were skin, adipose, muscle and a “shunt” compartment. These tissues are logical selections since they can be found in the vicinity of the antecubital vein in the forearm, the most common clinical sampling site. The “shunt” compartment describes the arterio-venous anastomoses in the skin of the hand, where there is a direct connection of arterioles to the venules (18). The model published by Levitt includes these tissues; however, they describe the shunt as a new tissue and state “it is assumed the tissue supplied by the Shunt has the same pharmacokinetic properties as skin”, whereas for one of the models validated in this study a direct arterial contribution has been considered in combination with the skin contribution. In addition, the Levitt model also incorporates an “other” compartment, representing the subcutaneous space and connective tissue, which was not available in the Simulator model. Assuming the summation of all fractions in the model is equal to a total of 1; different options were explored to assess the implications of assigning this fraction to components available in the current PBPK model. A schematic of the model is shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1 Current full-PBPK model in Simcyp with schematic representation of the peripheral sampling site model. The term Conc. fraction represents the fraction applied to each tissue concentration in the model



Four different model options were evaluated, three of which were variations of the fractions provided in the publication by Levitt (16). In the following equations, adipose/muscle/skin/lung conc refers to the tissue concentration observed in the simulation results and (t) refers to each time point where a predicted concentration has been output for the simulation. As the arterial concentration is not a standard output from the simulator, the lung concentration was converted, by dividing by KpLung/BP and used as a surrogate for the purposes of this exercise (Eq. 7). Kp is the tissue:plasma partition coefficient for the specified tissue which can be predicted using either the corrected Poulin and Theil (19–21), or Rodgers and Rowland (22–24) methods or measured data can be used directly. BP is the blood to plasma ratio required for the conversion of tissue concentration data to the concentration of drug exiting each tissue and entering the venous plasma at the peripheral sampling site.A. Modified Levitt arm (LAC) model

In this model, the fractions were based on those reported in the Levitt publication with the 10% assigned to ‘other’ being split equally between the skin, adipose, muscle and shunt: 1 PeripheralSiteConcentration(t)withrespecttoplasma=[0.1⋅AdiposeConc(t)Kpadipose/BP+0.075⋅MuscleConc(t)Kpmuscle/BP+0.275⋅SkinConc(t)Kpskin/BP+0.55⋅ShuntConc(t)]/BP 

The Levitt model assigns the same distribution parameters and volume/blood flow ratio to the shunt as the skin and therefore the skin concentration was initially used as a surrogate for the shunt: 2 ShuntConc(t)=SkinConc(t)KpSkin/BP 

B. Modified Levitt “skin” (LAS) model

In this instance, the 10% of the arm concentration assigned to ‘other’ by Levitt was assigned completely to the shunt (as skin concentration): 3 PeripheralSiteConcentration(t)withrespecttoplasma=[0.075⋅AdiposeConc(t)Kpadipose/BP+0.05⋅MuscleConc(t)Kpmuscle/BP+0.25⋅SkinConc(t)Kpskin/BP+0.625⋅ShuntConc(t)]/BP 

The shunt equation is the same in this model as described in the LAC model.

C. Modified Levitt arm “arterial” (LAA) model

The lack of arterial contribution in the shunt for the LAC and LAS model was not considered to be physiologically representative, so in the third model, the fraction for “other” was assigned to the shunt but used arterial concentration, as shown in Eq. 6. This 10% was removed from the skin fraction that was representing the shunt in the LAS model.

D. Physiological arm concentration (PAC) model

Literature searches were used to identify relevant physiological data that could describe the tissue concentration fractions required for this model. These fractions were derived from reported relative blood flows in the forearm (25–29). Unfortunately, these data are limited and no description of the contribution of the anastomoses to the antecubital vein blood flow could be obtained. The described fractions for this model therefore only refer to the adipose, muscle and skin concentrations: 4 PeripheralSiteConcentration(t)withrespecttoplasma=[0.1⋅AdiposeConc(t)Kpadipose/BP+0.6⋅MuscleConc(t)Kpmuscle/BP+0.3⋅SkinConc(t)Kpskin/BP]/BP 

Since the sampling volume is usually small in relation to the total blood volume, it was assumed to be negligible in this case, and therefore mass balance is maintained in the underlying PBPK model. Calculations of the peripheral site profile were performed in Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) using the mean concentration-time profiles for each tissue.

Following the initial validation steps of these models, the arterial contributing fraction in the LAA was varied from 0.02 to 0.625, with skin fraction in the shunt being increased/decreased to maintain a total shunt fraction of 0.625, to assess the impact on Cmax prediction and potentially further refine the model.



Compound Data and Simulations
Literature searches for drugs with an available Simcyp Simulator compound dataset were conducted to identify clinical studies where the dose was administered by i.v. infusion, and in vivo concentration-time data were available. Data extracted from the publications included the reported steady-state volume of distribution (Vss), in addition to the in vivo concentration-time data and study details. Where concentration-time data were only presented in figures, the data were extracted using the GetData graph digitiser version 2.22 (Get Data Graph Digitizer, 2012, http://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/) for comparative purposes. Where Vss was not reported for a specific study, this was obtained by non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix version 1.3 (Pharsight), utilising the extracted concentration-time profile data. Physicochemical and elimination data already present in the Simcyp compound file were utilised.

It was assumed that reasonable prediction of Vss can be used as an indication of the correctness of the predicted Kp values used in the PBPK model. However, clearly this is necessary but may not guarantee that all Kp values are correct. Since Vss is a description of the distribution under steady-state conditions, it should theoretically be unaffected by early distribution differences. For the purposes of these simulations, Kp values and the overall Vss were initially predicted using “Method 2” within the simulator. In some cases, the predicted Vss did not match the observed values; therefore, all tissue Kp values were scaled up or down to recover the observed Vss prior to the simulations being performed. Suitable values for the universal Kp scalar were determined using the inbuilt sensitivity analysis or parameter estimation tools within the platform.

Simulations were performed using the Simcyp Simulator (Version 13 release 1) (Simcyp, Sheffield, UK), with the provided healthy volunteer population and concentration time points equally divided over 2000 time points for the length of the simulation period. Study design and dosing regimen were matched to the published trial design for all studies.

Analysis and Comparisons
Visual comparisons of reported in vivo and predicted concentration-time profiles were made. Predicted Cmax values were compared with observed values. As the time point of the highest concentration (Tmax) in simulations can differ from the reported Tmax, predicted and observed concentrations were compared at the in vivo Tmax. This is due to the fact that the simulation reports 2000 time points whereas in clinical studies, a finite number of samples can be taken. The fold difference between these observed and predicted values for Cmax was calculated as a measure of prediction accuracy, with the number of results between 0.8- and 1.25-fold or within ±2-fold recorded. Predicted Cmax values within 2-fold of reported in vivo values were considered to be reasonable predictions. The prediction accuracy of all the models described above was compared for selection of the most suitable peripheral site model.

RESULTS

Comparison of Models
A visual comparison was made of the early-stage concentration-time profiles from published studies with predicted profiles using the different models described above. Selected key profiles are shown in Fig. 2, with results for all studies available in the supplementary material. Clear improvements in predictions can be seen for a number of studies, metoprolol and omeprazole in particular, with the LAA simulated Cmax generally closest to the observed Cmax. However, it can be noted from the profiles (see supplementary material) that in a number of cases, the simulated profiles for all of the models have converged at an earlier time point than an observation has been made in the in vivo studies. This is true even when a difference was predicted between the initial phase of the peripheral sampling site and central venous profiles and makes validation of the models difficult. The fold difference between the observed and predicted concentrations at the observed Tmax for all models is shown in Table II, with summary statistics in Table III and a graphical summary of the prediction accuracy for the LAA is given in Fig. 3. The LAA is considered to be the most accurate model, with all of the predicted concentrations within 2-fold of the observed values. This comparison confirms the utility of the corrective model, particularly for those compounds identified previously where early sampling time points are available. The final model selected based on these results was the LAA, which incorporates the arterial fraction in the shunt.Fig. 2 Observed and predicted concentration-time profiles for all models studied for a selection of studies. Black diamonds represent observed in vivo data. Red and blue lines represent the predicted arterial and central venous profiles, respectively.

Systematic Alteration of the Arterial Contribution
Changing the fractional contribution of the arterial concentration to the shunt resulted in an improvement for some compounds, bringing the Cmax predictions within a 0.8- to 1.25-fold range, while other compounds moved outside the 2-fold range (Table IV). A Cmax prediction within 2-fold of the in vivo value was observed for all studies when using the LAA with a fraction of 0.1 for the arterial contribution. Figure 4 gives a graphical representation of the consequences of changing this fraction, though due to extremely poor results, the arterial fraction of 0.625 is excluded from this figure. These observations suggest that the original fraction of 0.1 for arterial contribution was preferable and should be maintained in the final model. However, further validation with a larger observed dataset is required.Table IV Results from Changing the Arterial Fraction

DISCUSSION
A systematic validation and comparison of a number of methods to improve the prediction of Cmax from PBPK models has been performed and reported. Models that were evaluated were based on the full PBPK model in the Simcyp Simulator (Version 13 Release 1) and include standard tissue concentration outputs to describe the concentration-time profile for venous plasma at a peripheral sampling site, i.e. the antecubital vein. While the consideration was made at the inception of this model that construction of a PBPK model or compartment for arm might be a possible solution, the model selected allows the use of the existing physiologically based model as implemented in the Simulator and the associated outputs. This model provides an elegant solution where mass balance is maintained in the original model, and comparisons can be easily drawn between the concentrations in the central venous compartment and at the new peripheral sampling site. It is important to note that all of the validation is performed based on peripheral sampling data. The perfect scenario to validate this model would be the use of both peripheral and central venous or arterial sampling data for comparative purposes; however, such data are experimentally difficult and ethically questionable to obtain in humans.

Based on the current validation, the LAA model was considered to give the best performance of all of the models investigated, with the predicted Cmax closest to the observed values, and within the specified 2-fold range for all studies. This 2-fold range is a commonly used criterion for assessing the accuracy of predictions in in vitro–in vivo extrapolation and has recently been subject to some debate, with additional models for success criteria being proposed, though there is no consensus on the most appropriate method for validation (30). The LAA model is also considered to be the most physiologically accurate, where the shunt considers a contribution from the arterial blood in line with the role of the arterio-venous anastomoses in the skin of the hand, this is consistent with descriptions of the circulatory physiology of the skin (18). This contributing factor is absent from all other models investigated in this study (LAC, LAS and PAC). The lack of physiological data, particularly relating to the shunt, that could be identified in the literature when building the alternative PAC model is disappointing. This factor potentially contributes to the poor performance of this model in comparison to the LAA. The final variations of the arterial fractions made some improvement to the selected model for specific compounds, but led to a worsening prediction for others. Overall, it was considered that a model giving a reasonable prediction for all studies was preferred to improving the prediction of one or two compounds at the expense of accuracy for others, potentially skewing the model. Usually, over-fitting of a model for one or two cases can reduce its generalisation ability. In addition, the final value selected is in line with observed data cited by Chiou (7) where arterio-venous shunting in dog leg is observed to be approximately 4% of blood flow, which gives confidence that the final value of 10% is physiologically reasonable in the absence of any observed human data.

An assumption of the current approach is that accurate prediction of Vss means the Kp values are correct, so a drawback to the model is that it relies on the accurate prediction of Vss values within the underlying PBPK model. On this basis and using the in vivo Vss values, a fitting strategy was used to ensure the distribution volume was reasonably described (by an accurate Vss prediction) before proceeding to predict the peripheral sampling site concentration. Scaling of Kp values was required for all compounds apart from metoprolol. However, if in vivo data are lacking to validate the Vss or Kp values or if a bottom-up approach is intended, the confidence in the prediction of distribution cannot be validated. If animal data are available, these can be utilised within the model to ensure the distribution is reasonably described or the physicochemical properties of the compound can be used to guide the selection of a predictive model ((31–33), personal communication from Iain Gardner).

In the initial stages of this project, the use of different fractions in the models for compounds with different Vss values or physicochemical parameters was considered. This was ultimately dismissed, as the reason for the differences in the central venous and the peripheral sampling site concentrations depends on both the compound and physiological parameters, and therefore, the model structure should not be compound dependent. However, compound-specific differences may be evident in the concentration-time profiles, as lipophilic drugs will be expected to distribute more extensively into tissues leading to bigger site-specific concentration differences at early times after drug administration (7). These compound-specific differences are already incorporated in the underlying PBPK model, with lipophilicity and protein-binding considered as contributing factors for the prediction of Kp values. The resultant differences can be observed in the profiles provided in Fig. 2 and in the supplementary material, e.g. theophylline with low logP and Vss values has minimal differences between the concentration profiles for the central venous compartment and the peripheral sampling site model, whereas imipramine with both high Vss and logP shows significant differences. For other compounds, the contributions of these factors are less clear. The lack of reported early time points in the observed data for these compounds limits the conclusions that can be drawn as the convergence of predicted concentration profiles prior to the observed data hinders the determination of which model fits best in these circumstances. It is worth noting that omeprazole does not have a particularly high logP or Vss, and significant differences are noted in the profiles—suggesting other factors may also be contributing to this phenomenon (e.g. charge/compound type). With such a limited clinical dataset, it is challenging to explore the potential causes further and draw any strong conclusions. It should also be noted that no consideration was given to the accuracy of clearance values in this study, and the elimination phase of each simulated profile was not compared to the in vivo situation. The assumption is made that for low and moderate clearance compounds, there will be little impact on the Cmax value, meaning the simulated results remain valid for all of the compounds that were investigated in this study.

The selection of the predicted concentration at the time point of the highest observed concentration for the calculation of fold differences is a key factor in understanding the results. Comparisons can be drawn between the highest observed and predicted concentrations, but these could be potentially meaningless as the Tmax reported from the simulation can differ substantially from that observed. Over the course of each simulation in this study, 2000 data points are reported whereas the clinical/observed data is usually limited to around 10–20 samples over several hours. This can be particularly problematic for comparisons when the first sampling time point is much later than the end of infusion and/or the Tmax observed in the simulation, as there is no way of knowing what is happening in vivo where there are no reported observations. While all compounds showed an improvement in terms of fold error in Cmax prediction when using the LAA model, it is obvious from the comparison of the observed and simulated concentration-time profiles that the utility of the model can only be fully tested when concentration data for early sampling time points are available. This is in agreement with Chiou (7) and Shankaran (1) who highlighted the differences occurring in the initial phases of the concentration-time profiles. These time points are expected to be within the initial distribution phase (e.g. 5–10 min after administration), and samples taken at >30 min after administration are too late to observe the expected differences in the central venous and peripheral sampling site concentrations. Comparing the simulated profiles to the in vivo data (Fig. 2), it seems that only three studies, for metoprolol and omeprazole, had early enough time points to fully illustrate the benefit of using the corrective model and in most of these cases, only one point is relevant. As can be seen in Fig. 2 and also in the supplementary material, most studies have clearly reached an equilibration point before the first in vivo sampling time and the predicted profiles have converged. The differences between the models are mainly limited to the initial distribution phase, which is in line with the observations made by others in this arena (1, 7). A few exceptions arise in this dataset; in study 4 for alprazolam and study 7 for imipramine, the first sampling point is not until 30 min after infusion, yet a significant correction using the peripheral sampling site model was still observed at this time, suggesting that in some cases, distribution differences can persist for longer than the initial 5–10 min.

Another consideration is variability, as the model has been compared only to the highest concentration point extracted digitally from the mean concentration-time profile for each dataset. Cmax may not be at the same time for all individuals, hence biasing the Cmax of the mean concentration profile. Out of the 15 datasets studied, only two (34, 35) had tabulated Cmax and Tmax data for the i.v. study with a measure of variability (range or standard deviation) available. Variability in the reported Cmax values was <30%, and the reported mean Cmax (taken as the mean of individual Cmax values) was similar to the Cmax value determined from the mean concentration profile (12.6 vs 12.6 ng/mL and 146 vs 115 ng/mL for alprazolam and rosiglitazone, respectively). In addition, the numbers of subjects considered in the studies are relatively low (n values range from 1 to 14). Both of these issues could lead to uncertainty in the validation of the model. This is due to a paucity of data; in an ideal scenario, individual data for a large number of subjects would be available, ensuring that variability within the wider population is fully captured with best- and worst-case scenarios fully represented. This is a general problem with validating models and does not only apply to this study, but it becomes more pertinent when dealing with such a limited number of datasets. The Simulator reports concentration-time points for each simulated individual within a virtual trial for plasma and individual tissues, so if clinical data were available, further validation in this area would be feasible.

Expansion of the underlying models could also be considered in the future to include the effect of certain drugs on the cardiovascular system or the impact of the application of heat on the distribution at the sampling site. An example of this is metoprolol, which alters heart rate, cardiac output and consequently tissue blood flows (36, 37). If metoprolol distribution is perfusion-limited then it could be affected by the action of the drug on the blood flows. Similarly, the arterial contribution could be increased to mimic the effect of a temperature increase in the vicinity of the sampling site. While in the current study, it is assumed, in the absence of further information, that the conditions of a standard temperature and a sedentary subject are met, the use of a heat-box to induce an “arterialised concentration” at a venous site have been documented previously (38, 39). However, the development of such models is outside the scope of the current study.

The initial constraints of this investigation include the availability of both a library compound within the Simulator and an in vivo study utilising an infusion administration, the validation was therefore limited by the sampling points in those studies. Further i.v. infusion studies with relevant sampling time points have been identified for compounds not currently available in the Simcyp Simulator. This extended validation requires the development of additional compound files which was outside the scope of this initial study. As proof of concept, the improvement shown in this report seems to be adequate and allows a basis for further validation as well as investigation into potential applications within a number of different arenas.

CONCLUSION
A peripheral sampling site model that improves the prediction of Cmax values has been developed and validated in this study. The tissue fractions that constitute the sampling site concentration were tested for seven compounds and provide a good concordance between the observed and predicted Cmax values. Further validation is required with more compounds and clinical studies, particularly those with early sampling time points, to confirm the utility of the model. However, the potential for the use of such a model has been adequately illustrated herein. It is envisaged these models can be enrolled as built-up modules within PBPK platforms to address potential affections and variability of the initial mixing of the blood at the site of sampling (such as effect of heat, variation in adipose and muscle content of the body), and hence, they may give a more realistic simulated drug concentrations in blood or plasma at early time points.

This report summarizes rHuPH20 immunogenicity findings from clinical trials where rHuPH20 was co-administered with SC human immunoglobulin, trastuzumab, rituximab, or insulin. Plasma samples were obtained from evaluable subjects participating in ten different clinical trials as well as from healthy plasma donors. A bridging immunoassay and a modified hyaluronidase activity assay were used to determine rHuPH20-reactive antibody titers and neutralizing antibodies, respectively. rHuPH20-binding antibody populations from selected subjects with positive titers were affinity-purified and subjected to further characterization such as cross-reactivity with endogenous PH20. Among individual trials, the prevalence of pre-existing rHuPH20-reactive antibodies varied between 3 and 12%, excepting the primary immunodeficiency (PID) studies. Incidence of treatment-induced rHuPH20 antibodies was 2 to 18%, with the highest titers (81,920) observed in PID. No neutralizing antibodies were observed. Within most trials, the kinetics of antibody responses were comparable between pre-existing and treatment-induced antibody responses, although responses classified as persistent were more common in subjects with pre-existing titers. There was no association between antibody positivity and either local or systemic adverse events. Pre-existing and treatment-induced antibody populations were of similar immunoglobulin isotypes and cross-reacted to endogenous PH20 to similar extents. No cross-reactivity to PH20 paralogs was detected. rHuPH20 induces only modest immunogenicity which has no association with adverse events. In addition, antibodies purified from baseline-positive individuals are qualitatively similar to those purified from individuals developing rHuPH20-reactive antibodies following exposure to the enzyme.

INTRODUCTION
Hyaluronan (HA) is a mega-dalton glycosaminoglycan which constitutes a component of the extracellular matrix. Due to its viscosity and high water binding capacity, the HA viscoelastic gel forms a barrier to fluid flow and molecular movement through the interstitial collagenous matrix present in the hypodermis (1). This places a limit on the volume and composition of fluids and drugs that can be injected into the subcutaneous (SC) space. To overcome this limitation, hyaluronidases purified from bovine or ovine testes have been employed for decades to facilitate dispersion and absorption of subcutaneously injected solutions (2), but their clinical use has generally been limited by impurity profiles (1) and issues of hypersensitivity reactions (see for example (3)). More recently, the human testicular hyaluronidase (PH20, encoded by the gene SPAM1) was cloned and described as a GPI-anchored protein (4) that possesses hyaluronidase activity (5). This discovery allowed the engineering of a recombinant form of the human PH20 protein (rHuPH20) lacking the GPI anchor domain (6) which can be purified to homogeneity with a specific activity 50- to 100-fold greater than commercially available animal-derived hyaluronidase products.

The suitability of using rHuPH20 to facilitate dispersion of injected fluids and drugs was demonstrated preclinically in models employing rodents (1) as well as pigs (7–9). Clinical trials with rHuPH20 have been undertaken in the areas of rapid large volume hydration (10,11), rapid insulin and insulin analog delivery in subjects with diabetes (12–15), and delivery of large proteins such as immunoglobulins and monoclonal antibodies by SC rather than intravenous (IV) injections (9,16–21). Importantly, the use of SC rHuPH20 in combination with various drugs has been demonstrated to generate pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles that provide advantageous or comparable (i.e., noninferior) characteristics when compared to those obtained by IV injection of drug alone (16–20,22), and to increase the absorption rate of SC delivered insulin and its analogs (12,14,15) as well as morphine (23) among others. These data demonstrate the potential of rHuPH20 to facilitate the delivery of a variety of drugs in both acute and chronic clinical settings, either enabling transition to a more convenient, patient-friendly route of administration (e.g., conversion of treatments from IV to SC) or improving the PK profile of drugs that are typically administered SC (e.g., short acting insulin products).

Even though the use of human proteins as therapeutics can be expected to reduce immunogenicity relative to non-human proteins, the potential still exists of an antibody response. In fact, clinical immunogenicity of recombinant human proteins is frequently reported (24). The clinical relevance of those immune responses can vary widely and must be determined on a case-by-case basis through investigation of the impact of the immune response on product efficacy and safety. For example, anti-drug antibodies (ADA) may have significant impact on efficacy, through the development of neutralizing antibodies, and/or drug PK (25). Cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies with an endogenous counterpart can also occur, and in some cases this has been associated with grave clinical consequences (26). The potential impact of ADA has led to the development of regulatory guidelines for immunogenicity testing and reporting (27,28). Somewhat surprisingly, a number of cases have been reported in which pre-existing antibodies to biotherapeutics are present in a certain percentage of the population, prior to any exposure to the drug in question (29,30). The reason for these pre-existing antibodies is typically poorly understood, but their presence can complicate the interpretation of anti-drug antibody testing results obtained after administration of the drug in question.

Since rHuPH20 has been used clinically to facilitate dispersion and absorption of several co-administered biotherapeutic agents, it represents a unique opportunity to evaluate immunogenicity in multiple patient populations and dosing regimens. This report summarizes rHuPH20 immunogenicity findings from clinical trials where rHuPH20 was co-administered SC with human immunoglobulin, trastuzumab, rituximab, and insulin. In addition, a study was undertaken to determine the baseline prevalence of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies in the general population. Finally, antibodies from subjects who became positive for rHuPH20-reactive antibodies following exposure to rHuPH20 were characterized along with pre-existing antibodies from subjects who had never been treated with hyaluronidase. Results suggest that rHuPH20 induces only modest immunogenicity, with no meaningful changes to adverse event profiles. In addition, antibodies purified from individuals with pre-existing positive titers have isotypes and binding characteristics to endogenous PH20 similar to those purified from individuals developing rHuPH20-reactive antibodies following exposure to the protein.

Sample Collection
Blood samples, anticoagulated with EDTA, were obtained at the time of clinic visits according to the individual trial schedules. When relevant, samples were obtained immediately prior to the next scheduled treatment of rHuPH20 in order to avoid drug interference effects. Upon centrifugation, the resulting plasma was stored at approximately −20°C and transported frozen to the testing laboratory.

Assays for rHuPH20-Reactive and Neutralizing Antibodies
In order to detect antibodies to rHuPH20, an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging immunoassay was developed and validated according to recent regulatory guidelines (27,28) and white papers (31,32). After an overnight co-incubation of plasma sample diluted 1:5 with rHuPH20 conjugated to biotin and rHuPH20 conjugated to Sulfo-TAG (250 ng/mL each; Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD), the resulting immune complex was captured onto streptavidin-coated plates and detected in a SECTOR 2400 instrument using ECL Read buffer (all Meso Scale Discovery). A three-tiered approach was employed consisting of screening, specificity testing using unconjugated rHuPH20 as a competitor, and two-fold step-wise titering in negative base pool plasma diluted 1:5. Statistically based cut points for screening positivity, specificity, and titration were established as recommended in (32). Individual sample titers were defined as the last dilution that yielded a positive response. The positive control for this method was a rabbit anti-rHuPH20 antibody affinity-purified from a pool of serum from three rabbits immunized with rHuPH20 in Freund’s adjuvant. In order to determine assay sensitivity, a range of positive control concentrations was spiked into human plasma and evaluated using the bridging immunoassay to determine the threshold response versus the established screening cut point. While some of the ECL responses at 50 pg/mL fell above the assay cut point, all of the responses at 150 pg/mL were demonstrated to be greater than the cut point, and hence this conservative value was chosen to represent assay sensitivity. Taken into consideration the 1:5 dilution of plasma, the sensitivity of this assay was thus determined to be ≤750 pg/mL, a threshold that was 660-fold greater than the recommended 500 ng/mL for screening assays (28).

In the case of the HyQvia study, primary immunodeficiency (PID) subjects were treated with pools of human IgG, which were shown to contain low levels of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies. This is a reflection of the baseline prevalence of anti-rHuPH20 in the general population described in “Results” section. Consequently, subjects in this study who were identified as not being able to produce mature antibodies due to their underlying immunodeficiency syndrome (X-linked agammaglobulinemia, severe combined immunodeficiency, or hyper IgM syndrome) nonetheless presented with rHuPH20-reactive antibody titers ranging from 10 to 80, which were interpreted as the result of passive transfer of the antibodies contained in the therapeutic agent. Accordingly, HyQvia subjects were only considered to have a positive rHuPH20-reactive antibody response if a sample titer was ≥160.

An assay for neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against rHuPH20 was based on the USP assay for hyaluronidase activity (33). Briefly, plasma samples diluted 1:20 were pre-incubated with 2 U/mL rHuPH20 for at least an hour and was then allowed to digest high molecular weight hyaluronan for 30 min. Addition of acidified serum resulted in turbidity at 640 nm due to the presence of precipitated hyaluronan which was monitored spectrophotometrically; any neutralizing antibody in the plasma sample diminished the capability of rHuPH20 activity to lower the turbidity. The minimum required plasma dilution of 1:20 was determined based on the potential for interference by known plasma components such as inter-α-inhibitor (34).

For reporting immunogenicity responses, terms such as antibody prevalence, incidence, pre-existing and treatment-induced antibodies, kinetics (transient vs. persistent), and titer increase over baseline (treatment-boosting) were defined as in (35). In addition, the requirement for an increase of two or more titering steps in order to consider a baseline-positive subject treatment-boosted was also defined as in (35). In this case, since the titering took place in 2-fold steps, that meant that a 4-fold or higher increase in titer was required for such classification.

Adverse Events Analysis
For trial 160603/902, each reported adverse event in subjects that developed rHuPH20-reactive antibodies was graded mild, moderate, or severe, and the number of adverse events occurring prior to and following the first positive titer were added for these subjects and expressed per time unit to yield an adverse events rate.

rHuPH20-Reactive Antibody Purification
For further characterization, rHuPH20-reactive antibodies were affinity-purified from 130 to 250 mL plasma from four HyQvia subjects who had previously yielded ECL bridging immunoassay titers in excess of 10,000 and who had titers of 2560 to 10,240 at the time of providing the sample used as a source for antibody. As controls, 700–800 mL obtained by plasmapheresis of four healthy volunteers with rHuPH20-reactive antibody titers of 160–640 was included. For affinity chromatography, Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) was conjugated with rHuPH20 and packaged into Vantage chromatography columns (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) connected to an ÄKTA Purifier instrument (GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). Each plasma sample was diluted with 4 vol of TBS and loaded onto a fresh column, and antibodies were eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.5, and immediately neutralized. Following dialysis against PBS, samples were concentrated to 0.5–1 mL using 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off concentrators.

Antibody Isotyping
The resulting purified antibody preparations were isotyped using a Human/Non-Human Primate isotyping kit (Meso Scale Discovery), and IgG subclasses were determined using a Human IgG subclass profile ELISA for IgG1-IgG3 (Life Technologies), and separately using a Human IgG4 ELISA (eBioscience). Within each preparation, the amount of each isotype/subclass was expressed as a percentage of the total amount of antibody.

Evaluation of Antibody Cross-Reactivity
Endogenous PH20 was released from human sperm (Fairfax Cryobank, Fairfax, VA) by PI-PLC (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) treatment after capacitation with calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma-Aldrich). Recombinant human PH20 was also released by PI-PLC treatment from DG44-CHO cells stably transfected with a full-length cDNA construct, and affinity-purified using Sepharose 4B conjugated to a rabbit polyclonal anti-rHuPH20 antibody and otherwise as above. The concentration of human PH20 in both preparations was determined using a sandwich ECL assay using the rabbit polyclonal antibody as a capture antibody in ECL High Bind plates (Meso Scale Discovery) and a Sulfo-TAG conjugate of the same antibody as a detecting antibody. Plates were read in a SECTOR 2400 instrument and concentrations determined using four-parameter logistic regression on ECL signal obtained using a dilution series of rHuPH20 as a standard.

In order to compare the binding of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies to rHuPH20 and endogenous full-length human PH20, plasma samples confirmed positive for rHuPH20-reactive antibodies were diluted to yield an ECL signal around 5000 units (between 10- and 40-fold final dilution) and subjected to a version of the ECL bridging immunoassay described above wherein rHuPH20 conjugates were used at 100 ng/mL. In these experiments, increasing concentrations of unconjugated rHuPH20, sperm-derived PH20, and CHO-derived full-length PH20 were included to compete for binding to rHuPH20-reactive antibodies present in the sample. The resulting ECL signal/log competitor concentration curves were analyzed by four-parameter logistic regression where the top and bottom asymptotes were constrained as the ECL value obtained from the un-competed sample mean and the negative control mean, respectively, and the resulting IC50 value was reported.

To determine whether treatment-induced antibodies from subjects who participated in the HyQvia trial were capable of cross-reacting to recombinant human hyaluronidase (Hyal)1 and Hyal2, plasma samples from trial 160603/902 diluted 1:50 were assayed using the ECL bridging immunoassay described above in the presence of unlabeled test antigens added as competitors at a single concentration of 10 μg/mL. Insulin glulisine and rHuPH20 were used as a negative and positive control competitors, respectively.

RESULTS
Baseline Prevalence and Incidence of rHuPH20-Reactive Antibodies
The baseline prevalence of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies prior to exposure to the recombinant protein is summarized for each clinical trial in Table II and varied between 3.3 and 12.1%, except for the 160603/902 (primary immunodeficiency) trial where the baseline prevalence was only 1/87. This single antibody-positive subject had previously been exposed to rHuPH20 in an earlier trial where immunogenicity was not monitored, and hence the provenance of this titer (pre-existing or treatment-induced) is not known. In a study of 961 healthy plasma donors between the ages of 18 and 65, the prevalence of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies was 5.8%, similar to those observed in the various disease populations. There was no significant difference in prevalence among men and women (34/450 vs. 22/455, Fisher’s exact p = 0.13), and no association between rHuPH20-reactive antibody positivity and age.Table II Prevalence and Incidence of rHuPH20-Binding Antibodies in All Clinical Trials

fNote that this subject had previously participated in a trial of rHuPH20 and human IgG; however, during this previous trial immunogenicity monitoring was not performed. Hence, whether this subject was positive prior to any treatment with rHuPH20 is not known



The incidence of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies following rHuPH20 exposure is also shown in Table II and is defined as the percentage of subjects that were negative at baseline but who became positive following exposure (“treatment-induced”) plus the percentage of subjects that were positive at baseline and who had a 4-fold or higher increase of titer following exposure (“treatment-boosted”), as outlined in (35). In all cases, the number of treatment-induced subjects was greater than or similar to the number of treatment-boosted subjects. The overall incidence varied from 1.7 to 18.1%.

Samples testing positive for rHuPH20-reactive antibodies were assayed for their ability to neutralize rHuPH20 enzyme activity. No instance of neutralizing antibodies was found in any sample from any of these clinical trials.

Magnitude of rHuPH20-Reactive Antibody Responses
Titers of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies in the individual clinical trials are shown in Fig. 1a. When all studies were combined (excluding the plasma donor survey study), the median maximum rHuPH20-reactive antibody titer in subjects with positive titers at baseline and subjects who became antibody-positive de novo following exposure to rHuPH20, respectively, was 40 (range 5–10,240) and 40 (range 5–81,920). Generally, maximum titers of baseline and treatment-induced antibodies within each population were of similar magnitude, with two exceptions: Trial 117–206 (type II diabetes, co-administered with insulin) where the maximum titer increased following exposure, but was still only at a median of 160, and trial 160603/902 (primary immunodeficiency, co-administered with human IgG) where the highest titers in all of the trials were observed in five subjects (Fig. 2).Fig. 1

Observations for individual subjects with median and interquartile range are indicated. b Maximum fold titer increase in baseline-positive subjects following rHuPH20 exposure. Individual subject observations are indicated. Subjects with more than a 2-fold titer increase following rHuPH20 exposure were considered treatment-boosted (threshold indicated by gray line). Ten baseline-positive subjects that were never positive following rHuPH20 exposure are not included in this figure

The shaded area in each panel indicates the period of rHuPH20 exposure. The titers of the single subject with a positive titer (of 160) prior to participating in this study are shown in panel a




In the baseline-positive subjects, the fold change following exposure (Fig. 1b) did not indicate systematic titer boosting by rHuPH20, but some subjects (enumerated in Table II and shown in Fig. 1b above the gray threshold line) were considered treatment-boosted using the definition in (35). When all trials were considered together, treatment-boosting occurred in 29 of 110 evaluable baseline-positive subjects, whereas 71 baseline-positive subjects remained positive but not treatment-boosted, and ten baseline-positive subjects were not positive at any time following rHuPH20 exposure. The overall median fold titer change from baseline at post-exposure maximum was 2 (range 0.125–512). The highest extent of titer boosting was observed in one subject in trial 160603/902, who had previously been exposed to rHuPH20 (see above), as well as in one subject in trial 117–403 who had a baseline titer at 5 and a titer at 12 months of 2560.

While the highest rHuPH20-binding antibody titer responses were observed in the 160603/902 trial, titers rapidly peaked and then decreased despite continued exposure to rHuPH20. Figure 2 depicts the longitudinal time versus titer profiles for five subjects over the course of the study who had maximum antibody titers in excess of 5000. The subject previously exposed to rHuPH20 (panel a) had a rapid anti-rHuPH20 antibody response, and rHuPH20 exposure in this subject was stopped out of an abundance of caution for further evaluation while antibody titers were monitored over time. All other subjects (panels b–e) completed the rHuPH20 treatment period. Typically, titers peaked after study day 450 and then reverted back down while the subjects continued to receive rHuPH20 treatments.

Kinetics of rHuPH20-Reactive Antibody Responses
Evaluations of the kinetics of antibody responses were possible using data sets from six clinical trials where the period of antibody monitoring exceeded 16 weeks, or approximately 5 half-lives of IgG, in at least some of the subjects in the trial (35). The timing of the onset of antibody positivity (in subjects negative at baseline) and of the first sign of treatment boosting (in subjects positive at baseline) is summarized in Fig. 3a and is given as study day without taking the overall duration of the study into account, nor the frequency of rHuPH20 administration, so comparison between trials is not particularly informative. However, within trials, the onset of de novo antibody positivity and of antibody boosting was comparable, with one exception: the single baseline-positive subject in 160603/902 (who was previously exposed to rHuPH20, see above) had a very rapid onset of titer boosting compared to the timing of antibody positivity onset in the baseline-negative subjects in this trial. The timing of antibody titer maxima (Fig. 3b) also displayed a comparable pattern for baseline-positive subjects and for subjects with treatment-induced antibodies within each trial, except for trial 160603/902.Fig. 3 
a Onset of rHuPH20-reactive antibody boosting (see definition in legend for Fig. 1) in subjects testing positive for antibodies prior to treatment with rHuPH20 (“Baseline Boosted”) and in subjects first testing positive following rHuPH20 exposure (“Induced”). b Timing of maximum rHuPH20-reactive antibody titers in subjects testing positive for antibodies prior to treatment with rHuPH20 (“Baseline”) and subjects first testing positive following rHuPH20 exposure (“Induced”). Individual observations with median and interquartile range are indicated



Persistence of antibody positivity was determined in all subjects where the period of antibody monitoring exceeded 16 weeks. As seen in Fig. 4a, the duration of antibody positivity was generally longer in subjects who tested positive for antibodies before rHuPH20 exposure, except in the SABRINA trial where considerable overlap was observed. When the definitions for “persistent” antibody responses were applied according to (35) (see Fig. 4 legend for definition), the percent of antibody-positive subjects having persistent antibodies was always higher in the baseline-positive population (75 to 100%) than in the treatment-induced population (0 to 25%) (Fig. 4b).Fig. 4 Persistence of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies in subjects testing positive for antibodies prior to treatment with rHuPH20 (“Baseline”) and subjects first testing positive following rHuPH20 exposure (“Induced”). a Individual observations with median and interquartile range are indicated. b Percentage of subjects with “Persistent” antibodies according to the definition in (35) (first and last antibody-positive samples, irrespective of any negative samples in between, are separated by a period of 16 weeks or longer, or first antibody-positive sample is obtained less than 16 weeks before last sample obtained or end of study)



Lack of Association Between rHuPH20-Reactive Antibodies and Adverse Events
In order to determine whether any association between the conversion to antibody positivity and adverse events could be detected, data from trial 160603/902 were analyzed for all subjects who developed antibodies following rHuPH20 exposure (Table III). Results indicate that time-adjusted rates of both local and systemic adverse events classified as mild, moderate, and severe were comparable prior to and following first positive titer, with a slight decrease in each adverse event rate following rHuPH20-antibody positivity. The similarity of adverse event rates pre- and post-rHuPH20 antibody positivity also held true when the 15 subjects from trial 160603/902 were analyzed as a subset, or when the five subjects with the highest titers from this trial were considered on their own.Table III Summary of Adverse Eventsa in Baxter Trials in Subjects Who Developed Anti-rHuPH20 Antibodies

Characterization of rHuPH20-Reactive Antibodies
In order to compare the characteristics of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies that emerged following treatment with rHuPH20 (trial 160603/902, panels a–c and e in Fig. 2) and those present in baseline-positive individuals, rHuPH20 affinity chromatography was used to purify antibody preparations from subjects with titers at the time of plasma donation shown in Fig. 5a. Following purification, the lowest antibody concentration that could be detected using the bridging immunoassay was highly variable but within similar ranges for the two populations (Fig. 5b). Isotyping demonstrated that the two types of antibody preparations contained comparable proportions of IgM, IgG, and IgA (Fig. 5c), and percentages of individual IgG subclasses were also similar with the exception of a single elevated IgG4 level in the treatment-induced group (Fig. 5d).Fig. 5 Purification and characterization of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies from PID subjects with de novo positive antibody titers following exposure to rHuPH20 (treatment-induced, “TI”) as well as from the baseline-positive population with pre-existing rHuPH20 antibodies (baseline, “BL”). a Plasma titers at the time of antibody purification. b Lowest detectable concentration of purified rHuPH20-reactive antibodies in the ECL bridging assay. c Isotypes. d IgG subclasses. Observations from individual antibody preparations from four individuals each are indicated



Cross-reactivity of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies to related endogenous proteins, i.e., human sperm-derived PH20 and paralogous human hyaluronidase proteins, was studied because of the shared sequence homology between rHuPH20 and these other hyaluronidases (100% between rHuPH20 and endogenous PH20 with the exception of the C-terminal truncation, and between 34 and 42% homology with hyaluronidase (Hyal)-1, -2, -3, and -4 (36)). This evaluation was performed using a modification of the bridging immunoassay, where unlabeled proteins were used to compete in the bridging reaction. The data indicate that endogenous PH20 yielded similar results whether treatment-induced and pre-existing antibody preparations were tested (Fig. 6a), whereas rHuPH20 tended to inhibit bridging reactions with treatment-induced antibody preparations more efficiently than those with pre-existing antibodies (Fig. 6b). Under these circumstances, the highest concentration of rHuPH20 tested (2 μg/mL) inhibited the bridging signal observed with both treatment-induced and pre-existing antibodies by >99%.Fig. 6 Antibody cross-reactivity to endogenous PH20. a Representative example of results obtained in the ECL bridging competition assay with an individual rHuPH20-reactive antibody preparation when increasing concentrations of rHuPH20 or PH20 isolated from human sperm were included. b Resulting IC50 values calculated from individual antibody preparations.

In separate experiments, plasma samples from four 160603/902 subjects with the highest titer of rHuPH20-binding antibodies (as shown in Fig. 2a–d), as well as two subjects deemed antibody-negative, were evaluated for cross-reactivity to other human hyaluronidases (Hyal-1 and Hyal-2) as determined by competition by unlabeled protein at 10 μg/mL in the bridging immunoassay. In these studies, unlabeled rHuPH20 inhibited the bridging reaction between the biotinylated- and ruthenylated-rHuPH20 by greater than 99% in all samples except for the two negative samples (<23%). In contrast, the percentage inhibition for recombinant Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 as well as the glulisine negative control was less than 23% for all samples.

DISCUSSION
The recombinant hyaluronidase, rHuPH20, is used to facilitate SC delivery of protein therapeutics that would normally require intravenous infusion and can also be used to intentionally improve the PK profile of drugs that are usually administered by SC route. It is typically co-infused SC along with the therapeutic, either using sequential administration or using co-formulated drug product. In either case, rHuPH20 allows the therapeutic agent to permeate more readily through the SC space and gain access to the central circulation via either the capillaries, for small molecule therapeutics, or the lymphatics, for large molecule therapeutics. This report summarizes the clinical immunogenicity responses to rHuPH20 in several clinical trials, including rHuPH20 administered in combination with insulin, therapeutic antibodies, or human IgG to a total of 1526 subjects from diverse populations. Overall, exposure to rHuPH20 was associated with emergence of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies in 3 to 18% of treated individuals, depending on the trial. Of the 83 individuals who were antibody-negative prior to treatment and developed rHuPH20-binding titers after exposure to the protein, only three experienced maximum titers in excess of 10,000 using a highly sensitive bridging immunoassay. In addition, 28 subjects with pre-existing rHuPH20-reactive antibodies prior to exposure experienced treatment boosting, as defined by an increase in titer of two titering steps or more following treatment, and one of these experienced a maximum titer of 81,920, the highest titer observed following rHuPH20 exposure in this data set. Importantly, no neutralizing antibodies were identified in any of these trials.

The clinical importance of ADA responses can manifest itself in various ways: neutralizing antibodies can alter drug efficacy (25) and, in the worst case, can cross-neutralize the endogenous counterpart (26); both binding and neutralizing antibodies can have an impact of the PK of the drug (25); and circulating ADA-drug immune complexes can form with potential deleterious safety consequences (37). In the case of rHuPH20, no potential impact on function of endogenous PH20 should be expected since no neutralizing antibodies were observed. No clinical data are yet available regarding the potential effect of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies on PK of rHuPH20 itself; however, the action of rHuPH20 is localized to the SC space and no evidence of systemic exposure can be detected at the doses used (17). This might be related to the rapid elimination of rHuPH20 from the central compartment. Even when infused IV in human volunteers, rHuPH20 has a terminal elimination half-life of only 5–6 min (manuscript in preparation). Finally, with regards to immune complex formation, whereas IgG can theoretically distribute to the skin and lymph (38), there was no difference in adverse event rates in subjects who eventually became positive for rHuPH20-binding antibodies when periods prior to and following first positive titer were compared.

A consistent finding through all the trials was the presence of rHuPH20-binding antibodies in a small percentage of subjects prior to rHuPH20 exposure. This was confirmed in a separate survey study of 961 healthy plasma donors where the prevalence of pre-existing antibodies was determined to be 6%. The basis for why they are sometimes present remains unknown but may be related to immune reactivity to endogenous PH20, a GPI-anchored hyaluronidase normally present on the apical head of male sperm (4,5). Whatever their provenance, the presence of pre-existing rHuPH20-reactive antibodies does not appear to be associated with systematic titer boosting after exposure to rHuPH20 in the majority of subjects. Importantly, there were no adverse events associated with anti-rHuPH20 reactivity, with or without boosting.

The comparison of several clinical trials with unique study designs, dose levels of rHuPH20, and sampling schedules can be fraught with difficulty, which can limit the conclusions that can be drawn. In the current case, the various trials yielded similar results in terms of the nature of the rHuPH20 immunogenicity response: First, within trials, pre-existing and treatment-induced antibody titers were similar, as were their kinetics of onset of positivity versus onset of boosting as well as time to maximum titer. Second, if treatment-induced rHuPH20 antibody responses occurred, they tended to be more transient in nature than for pre-existing antibodies. The reason for this is currently unknown, but could possibly be related to the existence of a robust and long-lasting immune response to PH20 in individuals with pre-existing antibodies which predisposed towards more durable boosting. No data exists to date to address this question. Third, no neutralizing antibodies were observed in any clinical study.

The notable exception to this pattern was the response observed in the 160603/902 trial, where rHuPH20 was administered in combination with human IgG in subjects with primary immunodeficiency and induced a durable rHuPH20-binding antibody response with titers in excess of 5000 in five subjects. These titers generally diminished despite continuing treatment, and no neutralizing antibodies were ever observed; however, the nature of these responses was different from those observed in other clinical trials with rHuPH20. The reason for this could possibly be sought in the design of the trials (e.g., dosing frequency, total dose) or the co-administered therapeutic, in this case human IgG purified and pooled from plasma donors, which could contain low levels of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies due to the prevalence of such antibodies in the general population as described above. This latter notion was confirmed by analysis of preparations of human IgG which contained approximately 0.01–0.02% of rHuPH20-reactive antibodies (unpublished observations). Besides these differences, another potential reason for the differential immunogenicity response to rHuPH20 in the 160603/902 trial was the subject population. Primary immunodeficiencies constitute a diverse group of disorders of monogenic or polygenic origin, where the genetic basis of the disorder in the more frequently diagnosed disorders such as CVID is frequently unknown (39). Many of these diseases predispose affected subjects to dysregulated T-cell tolerance and autoimmunity (40,41), including CVID (42), which was diagnosed in three of the five cases in which the highest rHuPH20-reactive antibody titers were observed.

Beside the possibility that antibodies to rHuPH20 could attenuate in vivo enzymatic activity and produce a loss of dispersive effect at the injection site, the other theoretical concern is whether these antibodies could affect the functionality of endogenous PH20 or closely related enzymes. In vitro binding of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies to endogenous PH20 would be expected because of the high homology between rHuPH20 and PH20. On the other hand, binding of such antibodies to PH20 in vivo would be limited by the limited tissue expression profile of PH20 (adult male reproductive tract) as well as the blood-testis and blood-epididymal barriers limiting access of antibodies in systemic circulation to that milieu (43).

In order to address some of these concerns, treatment-induced rHuPH20-reactive antibodies as well as those from baseline-positive subjects were affinity-purified using rHuPH20-coupled resin and extensively characterized using various methods such as antibody titer, antibody isotype, and in vitro cross-reactivity to endogenous human PH20 and related hyaluronidases. The resulting antibody preparations from rHuPH20-treated and baseline-positive subjects had similar isotypes and IgG subclasses, suggesting that the degree to which immune class switching had taken place was comparable in both populations. Cross-reactivity analysis demonstrated that both types of antibody preparations bound to endogenous PH20 in vitro to a similar degree, whereas the treatment-induced antibodies bound somewhat better to rHuPH20 than did the pre-existing ones. This indicates that rHuPH20-binding antibodies emerging following treatment, even in the case of the comparably high titers occasionally observed in the 160603/902 trial, share molecular and immunological characteristics with those observed in more than 5% in the general population.

With respect to other human hyaluronidases, the risk of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies binding to them is lower because the primary structure of rHuPH20 is only distally related (i.e., 34 to 42% homology) to Hyal-1, -2, -3, and -4 (36). In support of this notion, none of these plasma samples cross-reacted to recombinant Hyal-1 or Hyal-2 when using the modified bridging immunoassay. This conclusion is corroborated by results from a tissue cross-reactivity study using the affinity-purified anti-rHuPH20 antibodies to stain different human tissues (unpublished observations); the only specific immunohistochemical staining observed was in the seminiferous tubules in the testis. This expression profile differs from that observed for other hyaluronidases, which are expressed in many tissues including lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney (44). If anti-rHuPH20 antibodies cross-reacted with other hyaluronidase family members, multiple tissues would have been expected to be positive in the tissue cross-reactivity study. Thus, the lack of signal in multiple assay systems indicates that anti-rHuPH20 antibodies did not cross-react with PH20 paralogs.

These observations serve to alleviate potential concerns raised by the apparent binding (although not neutralization) of a treatment-induced antibody to an endogenous protein involved in aspects of reproduction and are further supported by published reports in which several attempts were made to immunize males with PH20 as an immunocontraceptive approach in animal models. These studies involved rabbits (45,46), mice (47), and guinea pigs (48), and only the latter experienced infertility following PH20 immunization with a crude testicular extract that resulted in autoimmune orchitis (49). Furthermore, sperm from mice lacking PH20 were able to fertilize eggs, albeit in a somewhat delayed manner (50).

In conclusion, rHuPH20 is a recombinant human protein that appears to have modest immunogenicity and no deleterious effects on efficacy or adverse events. In addition, antibodies that bind to rHuPH20 are present in about one in 20 healthy individuals not exposed to the protein, and the functional characteristics of pre-existing and treatment-induced antibodies are similar. Therefore, rHuPH20 continues to constitute an attractive therapeutic option for delivering large molecules and fluid volumes via the SC route as an alternative to IV administration.

INTRODUCTION
Cardiotoxicity remains a major concern during drug development, with increased proarrhythmic potential being the main culprit. The pharmaceutical industry is challenged by the growing cost of research and development and cannot afford drug attrition in late phases of development or withdrawals of approved drugs. The ICH S7B non-clinical and E14-based clinical methodologies have been successful in their intent to reduce and eliminate drug-mediated torsades de pointes (TdP) arrhythmias as there have not been any withdrawals of marketed drugs for torsadogenic reasons since these guidelines were adopted (1). However, the current approach is conservative and can result in false positives. Thus, while effective, the current paradigm may be inappropriately assigning TdP liability to some drugs, especially in the discovery realm, so work is ongoing to shift from one that strongly relies on QT interval prolongation (or is “hERG-centric”) to one where proarrhythmic risk would be primarily assessed using non-clinical in vitro human models based on solid mechanistic considerations of TdP proarrhythmia (2) in conjunction with the current in vivo QT conscious canine and other non-rodent models.

Problems related to this drug-induced cardiotoxicity were discussed at a symposium entitled “A Gentle Touch on the Beating Heart: Early Discovery Prediction of Cardiotoxicity and Its Covariates” and conducted during the AAPS 2014 Annual Meeting. The aim of this mini-symposium was to present methods of predicting cardiotoxicity (which will be defined throughout this entire manuscript as a synonym of a proarrhythmic effect) from early discovery data. Three speakers from different backgrounds introduced the audience to the current safety testing paradigm, the latest achievements within drug safety and remaining hurdles regarding the integration of multiple sources of data acquired both at the preclinical and clinical level, and their translation to the human in vivo situation. Despite a reasonable knowledge of the mechanisms related to proarrhythmic cardiotoxicity, there are still questions whether the new paradigm of testing will be able to provide all stakeholders with a sufficient level of confidence with the application of these novel concepts and models to drug safety.

This article gives a short overview of the discussed problems, summarizes the discussion, and gives a flavor of a new cardiac safety testing pathway likely to be introduced in the near future. Some of the statements in the text, like the feasibility of the individualized risk assessment, can be contradictory what was left intentionally and shows the line of discussion between speakers. The three leading topics include a description of the molecular and clinical background of drug-induced proarrhythmic effects, a brief presentation of current methods used in the early prediction of such effects together with anticipated changes in the testing paradigm and a discussion of the in vitro–in vivo extrapolation approach, all of which promise the possibility of risk assessment at the individual patient level.

Molecular and Clinical Background of the Drug-Triggered Cardiac Arrhythmia
The development of TdP is a potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia that can occur as an unintended result of drug therapy of various, in many cases relatively benign, conditions. It’s rare occurrence hinders TdP observation considerably during the conduct of clinical trials, thus necessitating the use of surrogate markers. For most medications known to cause torsades, TdP is a result of repolarization delay or alterations clinically reflected by QT interval prolongation on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Despite being considered an imperfect biomarker with compromised sensitivity and specificity and lack of a straightforward correlation with TdP occurrence, QT interval prolongation remains the most globally used biomarker to assess the proarrhythmic propensity of a drug (3,4). QT interval prolongation is a mechanism-based effect resulting primarily from the inhibition of rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) mediated by ion channels encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG or Kv11.1). It has been shown that in vitro measured IKr inhibition potency expressed as an IC50 value correlates with the clinically observed arrhythmia occurrence (5,6). This fact is reflected in the regulatory requirements, which require such in vitro study to be conducted before a first-in-human trial (7). Despite the importance of the hERG channel in safety pharmacology, studies investigating hERG channel exclusively might not fully reflect the drug potential in modifying cardiac ionic currents. Since the action potential of ventricular cardiomyocytes is a result of complex interplay between inward and outward ionic currents, drug interaction with an inward current can alter the effect of hERG inhibition of outward current and hence may limit effects on the QT interval and subsequent assessed proarrhythmic potential. Indeed, there are potent hERG inhibitors devoid of TdP risk (e.g., verapamil, propafenone, amiodarone, ranolazine) because of either a counteraction to potassium current inhibition by either sodium or calcium channel blockade or other potential antiarrhythmic mechanisms (8,9). On the other hand, alfuzosin is an example of a drug with negligible hERG liability although it causes QTc interval prolongation by increasing sodium current (8–11). Therefore, one of the proposed changes to be implemented into cardiac safety testing is an evaluation of the drug effects on multiple cardiac ionic currents. Recently, Kramer et al. (12) assessed whether determining concomitant block of multiple ion channels could more accurately predict the torsadogenic potential of a compound rather than just examining the effects on hERG alone. The application of logistic regression models using data derived from high-throughput screening multiple ion channel electrophysiology (MICE) methods showed that for the known 23 non-torsadogenic and 32 torsadogenic drugs from multiple classes tested that there was a significant reduction in false positives (i.e., type 1 errors) and false negatives (i.e., type 2 errors) when compared to assessment using the hERG assay alone.

Currently, there are efforts to develop a Comprehensive In vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CIPA) that aims to modify and modernize current non-clinical, “hERG-centric” cardiac safety screening efforts (2,13,14). Current alternative screening models and methods under consideration for the CIPA initiative include stem cells in which hERG (Kv11.1; IKr current) as well as other cardiac ion channels such as the fast sodium (Nav1.5; INa current) channel, persistent sodium channel (INasus), calcium (Cav1.2; ICa current) channel as well as potassium channels such as the inward rectifier (Kir2.1-2.4; IK1 current), and slow delayed rectifying (Kv7.1; IKs current) channel can be assessed in totality (15). Rather than examining human ion channel isoforms heterogeneously expressed in cell lines (such as CHO or HEK) as is current practice in drug safety, there is ongoing investigation of the applicability of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (16). The undifferentiated human stem cell of embryonic origin (hESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) of somatic origin continue to be evaluated for their cardiac electrophysiological potential for use as a drug screening assay (16–19). Intracellular recordings from individual cells and multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) enable measurement of sodium, calcium, and potassium current from stem cells (16). Note, however, that a limitation to the use of stem cells that are currently being evaluated is that these cells are immature with regard to their electrophysiological properties. Stem cells, to date, do not appear to fully express all channels at the same density and at the same proportion as occurs in human ventricular myocytes (20).

Multi-channel interactions, hERG-independent proarrhythmia mechanisms, active metabolites, or antiarrhythmic effects of a drug are not the only reasons for a lack of absolute concordance of risk estimates based on surrogate markers with actual TdP risk in a patient population. Apart from pharmacodynamic effects, TdP occurrence is influenced by many factors that define inter- and intra-individual variability (21–23). It is known that TdP occurrence heavily depends on concomitant risk factors including age, gender, electrolyte imbalance, heart rate (specifically bradycardia), and presence of structural heart disease. Also, the actual risk for an individual patient is variable with individual circadian rhythms (i.e., heart rate, serum electrolyte levels), and rhythms with a longer periodicity (related to the effects of sex hormones) can influence the individual response of the heart to drugs (24,25). Mechanisms responsible for the development of cardiac arrhythmias may be categorized according to those that modify impulse formation (such as altered normal automaticity or triggered activity caused by early or delayed afterdepolarizations) or conduction (such as that due to re-entry or re-excitation of cardiac tissue).

In humans, the most common causes of arrhythmias include myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, or reperfusion of a previously ischemic myocardium. These conditions can be readily reproduced in both intact and isolated hearts in many species. While the pathogenesis of arrhythmias may not appear to be relevant to drug safety, it is the mechanism(s) derived from decades of arrhythmia studies that is being used to define and explain drug-induced arrhythmogenesis. These reported mechanisms may have direct implications in the development of the CIPA paradigm and its ability to provide additional information regarding the “proarrhythmia potential” for a new drug. The mechanism(s) that have been developed will be important in the interpretation of ion channel data and the predicted changes in the action potential using suggested in silico models.

Abnormal impulse generation that may be responsible for induction of TdP arrhythmias may arise from oscillations in the membrane potential and has been characterized as a “triggered” rhythm (26). These triggered rhythms occur in two forms: early or late afterdepolarizations (EAD or DAD). Early afterdepolarizations interrupt either phase 2 or 3 repolarization of the AP. If these afterdepolarizations attain sufficient thresholds, they may produce triggered responses and induce single or multiple extrasystoles or polymorphic VT episodes such as TdP. The EAD is an oscillatory potential that is sensitive to frequency and often occurs at slow stimulation rates. EAD activity has been shown in vitro using many types of isolated cardiac tissue and various cell types including mid-myocardial cells (M-cell) (27). Induction of EAD activity can be induced by a variety of drugs that block sodium and potassium channels. When a transient depolarization occurs during phase 4 of the cardiac AP, it is termed a delayed afterdepolarization (DAD) which is vitally dependent upon the rate of the preceding action potential. Thus, the amplitudes of DADs increase with decreasing cycle lengths (28). DADs have been observed under a variety of experimental conditions, all of which have a similar end result—intracellular Ca2+ overload. High intracellular Ca2+ concentrations saturate sarcoplasmic reticulum sequestration mechanisms resulting in Ca2+ oscillations due to Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (29). The ionic currents that contribute to this mechanism are not known.

For many years, there has been an effort to mathematically describe the genesis of the cardiac action potential. Primarily driven by academic research groups, there is now ongoing integration of these in silico research methods to the CIPA initiative. Of the many in silico models developed, it is the O’Hara-Rudy model that will likely form the basis for the in silico component of CIPA (30). The O’Hara model is a human ventricular cardiac AP model based upon data measured from over 100 undiseased human hearts. Components of the model were evaluated over the human range of physiological frequencies and include calcium versus voltage-dependent inactivation of L-type calcium current (ICaL); realistic kinetics for the transient outward, rapid delayed rectifier (IKr), and inward rectifier (IK1) potassium currents along with the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (INaCa). The authors also examined model response to rate dependence and restitution of cardiac AP duration (APD).

Overview of Methods and Models Used in Assessment of Drug-Induced Cardiotoxicity During Drug Development
The critical nature of cardiac liability determination and implementation of an appropriate strategy for drug safety assessment resulted in the development of three guidelines that outlined non-clinical (ICH S7A; ICH S7B) and clinical (ICH E14) testing strategies (7,31–33). The current non-clinical testing strategy includes in vitro IKr current assessment in heterologous mammalian cell lines expressing the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG, Kv11.1) channels, which have been agreed to play a crucial role in human cardiac electrophysiology. The preclinical guidelines propose that sponsors consider other complementary models. These include a number of in vitro assays that have been well characterized with utility in the safety profiling of a new chemical entity (NCE). These assays include assessment of drug effects in the isolated rabbit Purkinje fiber preparation, the isolated Langendorff heart, and the isolated wedge preparation. Cardiac safety pharmacology in vivo methods primarily use conscious telemetered animals to assess the effects of the test item on the QT interval. Variables that are usually recorded in the dog and other non-rodent species include heart rate and the ECG. Thus, a variety of tests are used to evaluate drug safety and include effects primarily on blood pressure, heart rate, the ECG, repolarization (APD), the hERG (IKr) ion channel, and cardiac conduction.

An additional consideration to drug effects on heart rhythm involves cardiac (ventricular) contractility. This has largely been neglected by safety scientists and has only recently become of potential interest in the cardiovascular safety milieu (34). Contractility, it is thought could initially represent a complementary readout to the current cardiovascular endpoints assessed under the core-battery ICH S7A guidance, but this could change. Several papers have recently been published that evaluate direct measures of contractility (in vivo), and contractility variables include left ventricular pressure (LVP) and rate of contraction and relaxation (±dP/dtmax) recorded directly via invasive catheter implantation (34,35).

Regardless of the constituents, the resultant data, in addition to data acquired from acute and/or chronic toxicology studies, are recommended to be analyzed using an integrated risk assessment (IRA) (36). The IRA is a holistic evaluation of non-clinical study results and is used because there has been no conclusion regarding which single non-clinical model could be used to accurately address issues highlighted by the regulatory guidance documents. However, the value ascribed to data derived from in vitro and in vivo studies is limited by other factors which may distort the perceived safety of a drug (37,38). These factors include differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship between animals and humans as well as differences between species regarding metabolism and plasma protein binding as well as variability in species dependence of TdP susceptibility (39). Despite such differences, the assays currently used in non-clinical safety studies can be used to inform the planning of clinical trials. Note that the information acquired during the conduct of human trials will always surpass that of the non-clinical studies in terms of relevance.

Conduct of a clinical development program, prior to approval application, provides a rigorous assessment of the drug’s propensity to prolong the QT interval in humans. Thorough QT studies (TQT) involve quantification of the degree of the drug’s influence on cardiac repolarization in healthy volunteers as compared to placebo and a positive control (moxifloxacin). The aim of the TQT studies is to identify drugs that clinically require more attention toward the potential for development of a cardiac liability and therefore require additional ECG monitoring in subsequent clinical trials to assess arrhythmia risk in the target patient population. Although the TQT studies are informative and the best amongst the currently available methods, they may not be cost-effective and suffer from a low positive predictive value (40).

The classical approach to the assessment of proarrhythmia occurs via the so called thorough QT (TQT) study that looks for the largest excursion following a dose (a guard against hysteresis) and checks whether the upper confidence limit excludes the effect size deemed of potential clinical relevance. Using the ICH E14 guidance, the upper 90% confidence limit and a boundary of 10 ms defines the risk. However, hysteresis is rarely observed in practice, so this procedure is both inefficient in the use of available data to look for an effect and is biased toward incompletely compensating for multiplicity by taking the largest observed value amongst several time points.

Exposure-response modeling offers advantages in efficiency by combining what is known across all time points and several doses. It is also relatively simple because there is usually a linear relationship between exposure and QT for the small effects that are of interest. Indeed, such assessments have long been performed as supplements to the classical analyses of TQT studies. However, as supplementary analyses, these have not had full prespecification and are thus regarded as exploratory.

Recent work has taken a more systematic approach, with full prespecification of analytic methods, including tests for linearity. Retrospective application of formal methods of exposure-response analysis across selected studies was found to be encouraging, but Food and Drug Administration (FDA) insisted on a prospective study, too, and named a small set of drugs and doses with peak effects in the neighborhood of 10 ms to be assessed (41)

The conducted study was a three-period, third-party blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 20 healthy volunteers. The design was planned to be similar to a single ascending dose (SAD) phase 1 study with the primary objective to estimate the effect of the drugs on the QTc interval using ER analysis. Each subject undergo three treatment periods. An incomplete block design was used what resulted in each study drug being administered to nine subjects and placebo to six subjects in separate periods. The design, sample size, and statistical approach is intended to result in similar power to exclude clinically relevant QTc effects as a standard SAD FIM study (41).

Exposure-response methods have now been established in order to provide a more efficient assessment of the QT interval, making such an assessment potentially a part of early phase clinical studies where the highest doses are likely to be utilized, and obviating conduct of a dedicated, expensive TQT study. However, this methodology still makes use of a biomarker whose correlation to proarrhythmic risk is not absolute.

To address the deeper problem, we can potentially make use of fundamental understanding of the mechanism by which torsade-like arrhythmias are generated, and the ability to assess in vitro drug effects on the machinery derived from humans.

Torsade occurrence requires two things. The first is a relative failure of the cardiac myocyte to execute the repolarization phase of the action potential. Following the upstroke and plateau phases, the myocyte should re-establish polarity, allowing the trigger to be reset for the next action potential at its expected time. During this time, the repolarization forces, in the form of outward currents, must be vigorous enough to suppress any residual tendency for regenerative activity. Thus, inadequate outward current activity during this time allows inward, depolarizing current to get the upper hand leading to “early afterdepolarizations” (EADs), essentially, new action potentials happening long before they are due.

As long as these EADs happen more or less throughout the myocardium in synchrony, they are generally harmless. At least, following one bad beat, things are likely to settle back to normal activity (42,43). This is why patients with intrinsic or drug-induced problems with repolarization can live decades without a fatal arrhythmia. So, the second criterion for setting up an arrhythmia is some degree of heterogeneity in the heart. If all parts of the heart are not working in synchrony, say, because of regional ischemic disease, scarring due to an healed infarct, etc., the errant action potential has some place to conduct and then is able to back-propagate and re-excite cardiac tissue into what becomes a circuitous activity (42). During such an event, the usual muscular coordination is lost and the pumping action of the heart is interrupted. Such effect has been widely studied and discussed from various perspectives (44).

Although we can find evidence for the electrical uncoupling in the heart and can model its effects to gain insights into proarrhythmic mechanisms, fully characterizing a patient’s intrinsic risk in this regard lies outside what is technically feasible today. Judging when an arrhythmia will occur and in whom is not possible. Judging which drugs are likely to create the conditions that give rise to EADs is, on the other hand, quite feasible (see above). Cardiac myocytes have multiple ion channel types (see Fig. 1), and the human channels of each type can be studied in isolation in cells overexpressing single types. Each channel type can have the effect of a drug assessed in vitro under voltage clamp conditions, and high-throughput systems permit replicate experiments, exposure-response characterization, etc. to be performed at modest cost. If you know the channel densities in human cardiac myocytes, you can then reconstruct the human cardiac myocyte action potential, as it is influenced by time-varying drug exposure, in silico, and look for the propensity to produce EADs. That is, at the level of the individual human cardiac ventricular myocyte, the process of developing an action potential is completely understood, and drug effects can be completely characterized.Fig. 1 A cardiac action potential that outlines the major currents involved in depolarization and repolarization of the cell membrane. The cardiac action potential (AP) conventionally consists of several phases (0–4) with a duration of ∼300 ms. Phase 0 corresponds to membrane depolarization (Na+ influx thru I
Na channels) while phase 1 shows the early rapid repolarization of the membrane due to activation of the transient outward (I
to) K current. Phase 2 is the plateau of the AP (due to a reduction in Na+ influx) and an increase in Ca2+ influx (thru I
Ca channels) while phase 3 shows membrane repolarization resulting from the coordinated opening and closing of many different K+ channels such as the rapid (I
Kr) and slow (I
Ks) components of the delayed rectifier K channel. Phase 4 corresponds to the resting membrane potential and is maintained by the inward rectifier (I
K1) channel. The effects of a drug that produces a prolongation in the AP by blockade of I
Kr is shown (drug (circle))



Because this technology assesses drug effects across all, or most, of the set of cardiac ion channel types, it should have the ability to detect drugs with isolated adverse effects on repolarization and to differentiate those drugs from the ones with mixed effects on depolarizing and repolarizing forces, resulting in less net risk.

In practice, there are some uncertainties. For example, you cannot be sure that the voltage clamp protocol you used will always capture the effect of a drug on the ion channel, because that effect may depend on some aspect of the channel’s history that your protocol did not account for. There can also be effects of drugs that are not the result of direct interaction with the channel protein. It is, therefore, of interest to augment such a channel-based assay with some information from a more integrated (and thus less easily characterized) system. Two such candidates are being explored.

Ventricular myocytes can be obtained directly from adult human ventricles, but sufficient availability cannot yet be guaranteed by vendor sources (45). Human embryonic or pluripotent stem cells can be induced to form ventricular myocytes, which can be cultured in vast numbers, and these are available from numerous commercial sources. While they do not currently replicate the electrophysiological phenotype of myocytes from the adult human heart, they can be used, once correctly engineered, to provide some assessment of drug effects that might be missed by the use of the hERG channel-based assay alone.

Another approach to attaining supplementary information on drug effects is to return to the human ECG. The upstroke of the action potential is reflected in the QRS interval of the ECG, and repolarization is represented by the QT interval. Drugs with a variety of known channel effects have predictable effects on the morphology of the ECG waveform, and understanding these relationships and what is meant by their changes can help make predictions about underlying channel effects (with potential clinical implications) of novel drugs.

In Vitro–In Vivo Extrapolation of a Drugs’ Proarrhythmic Effect—From High-Throughput to Rare Case Analysis
All the abovementioned methods focus on a single compound or at most in combination with metabolites when an in vivo system is in use, and idealistic (or non-realistic) conditions which are not complimentary with the real life situation where the drug of interest is used. Even a cursory analysis of the literature-reported TdP cases suspected to be drug-triggered depicts one element which seems to be overlooked, namely the influence of external factors.

Multiple elements can be listed as external factors, and the list below does not cover all possible components:Concomitant drugs and the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) drug–drug interactions

Food and other environmental factors

Demographic and physiological parameters and their drug-triggered modification

Genetic factors and comorbidity



Apart from a direct influence on the drug affinity to the channels, all of the above-listed elements can modify drug pharmacokinetics. It has been widely proven that the variability of physiological parameters directly modify drug pharmacokinetics and exposure (46–48). Therefore, cardiac risk should ideally be assessed at the level of the individual patient and also account for non-drug-related parameters potentially triggering serious health-threatening situations. Examples of such situations can be highlighted amongst the drugs which are currently on the market or were withdrawn due to non-acceptable cardiac risk. To support such a statement, a brief, non-exhaustive analysis and description of the commonly known proarrhythmic drugs has been performed and discussed to draw attention to the role of these non-drug parameters.

Cisapride is often given as an exemplary non-cardiology drug associated with the risk of TdP (49). Cisapride, a serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonist, was developed in 1980 as a prokinetic agent that increased gastrointestinal motility. It has also been used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. In vitro studies revealed that it was a potent IKr current inhibitor with in vitro measured IC50 values in the range of 4.3–100 nM depending on the study settings (50). However, it has other ion channel properties that include late calcium (ICaL) current inhibition with IC50 values in the micromolar range (51). According to all known classification schemes including those developed by Redfern, Mirams, and Crediblemeds (https://www.crediblemeds.org/), it is a drug associated with a high propensity for proarrhythmic risk (9,52,53). This assignment of risk is based on case reports of side effect including TdP and other types of arrhythmias, especially when the medication was taken concomitantly with other medications or in patients with certain underlying conditions predisposing them to arrhythmias. Wysowski et al. analyzed the post-marketing reports of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia associated with cisapride (54). From 1993 until 1999, while being marketed in the USA, the FDA received 341 individual patient reports of multiple heart-related conditions including 117 associated with QT prolongation, 107 with TdP, 16 with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and 27 with ventricular tachycardia. Eighty (23%) of the 341 patients died. The authors concluded that in most cases, an arrhythmia occurred in the presence of additional, complex risk factors including the presence of other drugs and/or variant medical conditions. Among other strictly contraindicated factors that were listed include concomitant use of CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors, serious heart conditions, electrolyte disorders, and overdose. A similar situation was reported in the case study provided by Hussain and Ghazal (55). These authors report the medical situation of a 36-year-old woman presented to the emergency room after 3 days of abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting preceded by a Caesarean section. She was treated by multiple drugs including antiarrhythmic drugs and cisapride which were considered as the reasons for the developed ventricular tachycardia which degenerated to frequent episodes of TdP. After testing multiple factors, the authors concluded that the observed TdP might not be solely due to drug-induced QT interval prolongation. Other factors discussed by the attending clinicians include those caused by hypokalemia resulting from repeated vomiting and poor nutritional intake and metabolic drug–drug interactions which altered cisapride exposure. Cisapride was withdrawn from many global markets in 2000 but remains available for use in some EU countries to specific patients under strict black-box restrictions. Use by these specific patients requires that both health care providers and patients receiving cisapride are familiar with this complication associated with use and that all parties understand and comply with specific recommendations outlined and required for use.

Trimebutine, a drug used to regulate motility in the gastrointestinal tract via an agonist effect on peripheral μ-, κ-, and δ- opiate receptors and modulation of gastrointestinal and extragastric peptide release (i.e., motilin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, gastrin, and glucagon), is provided as an example distinctly different from that of cisapride. Trimebutine is a weak inhibitor of IKr currents in guinea pig ventricular myocytes as described by Morisawa and colleagues, with negligible effects, even at concentrations much higher than those in clinical use (56). As may be expected, based on such studies, trimebutine is classified as a drug without known TdP risk (53). Surprisingly, a Eudravigilance system (i.e., a data processing network and management system for reporting and evaluating suspected adverse drug reactions) query resulted in the finding of two records that involve cases of TdP associated with its use (57). Both cases were reported by health care professionals which increases their potential credibility, but interestingly, both cases concern effects on elderly patients (65–85 years of age). Such reports do not provide a complete set of information and obviously cannot be used as strong evidence of potential risk but can be used in signal generation. Additionally, a quick literature search (scholar.google.com) found one report where significant QT interval prolongation and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was observed with high doses of trimebutine (58). Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, as opposed to the polymorphic variant, is less dangerous and more easily manageable but can degenerate to a polymorphic form including TdP. The authors conclude that while there may be a causal association between the occurrence of arrhythmia and the use of high doses of trimebutine, it is only probable. However, this may be sufficient to warrant further review to quantify drug and non-drug-related triggering factors (in this case—sex, age, and plasma electrolytes).

In most cases, the clinically observed effect is likely the consequence of the multiple actions the drug impart on varying physiological systems. For some drugs, metabolites contain inhibitory activity against ionic currents; therefore, knowledge about their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics allows for a better prediction of the cardiac effects and clinical data interpretation. In 2010, after 13 years of a presence on market, the US FDA issued a safety announcement regarding Anzemet (dolasetron mesylate—an antiemetic 5-HT3 receptor inhibitor) use, informing patients and health professionals that the injectable form of Anzemet should no longer be used to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy (CINV) in pediatric and adult patients (59,60). Such a decision was undertaken after review of dolasetron-induced TdP cases (61). The drug can still be used in postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis and treatment because lower doses are used for these indications. Dolasetron is rapidly metabolized to a reduced form of hydrodolasetron (MDL 74,156) by carbonyl reductase, an enzyme widely distributed in human tissues (62,63). In view of this manner of metabolism, dolasetron is considered as a prodrug that is converted to hydrodolasetron, which is believed to be responsible for the majority of clinical activity (64,65). Additionally 5′-OH and 6′-OH metabolite derivatives are considered as carrying partial activity. When given orally, dolasetron plasma concentration is in most cases undetectable and its pharmacological activity is negligible, although after intravenous injection both active moieties are present at the site of action and trigger potential cardiac effects. Orally taken, dolasetron formulations are still in use for all indications and considered as safe (66). There was however a case study published where a massive orally taken dolasetron dose (2000 mg, p.o.) was taken. The patient’s ECG showed first-degree heart block along with non-specific intraventricular conduction delay and a prolonged QTc interval (67).

The above given example indicates that the route-dependent kinetic actions of drugs should be considered during drug safety analysis and that a combination of the active substances (i.e., parent and metabolites) rather than a single entity (i.e., the parent molecule) should be studied for safety purposes. This is done depending upon the levels of the metabolites in the plasma (>10%) and whether they can be synthesized and tested alone. Similarly, toxicology species are assessed for parent and metabolite PK parameters to ensure that adequate exposure of parent and metabolites occurs during long-term toxicity assessments. There are multiple examples of drug–drug interactions at the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic level which trigger potential toxic effects with terfenadine and ketoconazole being probably the most well-known examples (68). Consequences of the latter are relatively easy to predict as ketoconazole-driven CYP3A4 inhibition and subsequent blockade of terfenadine metabolism resulted in substantial increases in terfenadine blood concentrations in combination with potent inhibition of the IKr current resulted in QT interval prolongation and precipitation of TdP arrhythmias. At the daily routine level, what is probably most important to assess is the non-linear effect of the drug combination. Such a situation was described for droperidol and ondansetron where, despite of lack of exposure modification after concomitant dosing, the QT interval was prolonged, but the observed prolongation was not proportional to the QT prolongation observed for two drugs given separately (69).

Considering the complexity of the above-listed phenomena, their thorough analysis during the conduct of clinical trials would be very challenging, if not impossible. What’s more, clinical trial characteristics, namely a relatively small cohort, homogeneity of the included individuals, short period of drug exposure, rare drug–drug and drug–environment interaction analysis, could contribute to relatively poor prediction of rare cases observed in subsequent clinical studies. The solution might be the development of a relatively tight safety margin for the analyzed TdP risk surrogate as was proposed in the ICH E14 guideline. There is however a cost connected with that as it might, and probably has, provoked genesis of a high percentage of false positives and thus a high clinical attrition rate of many drug candidates (1). As was mentioned above, this was one of the reasons for the inception of a new cardiac safety testing paradigm discussion and likely introduction. An inevitable component of this new paradigm is in silico methods which should became a vital element of cardiac safety testing. These include various approaches, starting from screening methods (QSAR-based models), up to the utilization of the biophysically detailed cardiac myocyte models (15,70). The latter techniques vary with regard of the level of complexity of the mathematical description of the cardiac physiology at the ion channel (Hodgkin-Huxley or Markovian notation) and cell level (single cell up to the three-dimensional heart structure) (71,72). Such methods offer the possibility to incorporate variability of either stochastic or deterministic nature (73,74). This can further allow for the drug cardiac safety analysis at the population level and quantitative assessment of the combination of drug and non-drug-related parameters (36,75,76).

Some elements should include the need for proper exposure quantification. The effect at the clinical level is related to the concentrations of the tested substances. However, plasma drug concentration (which is the most common effective concentration surrogate) can be imperfect as it may vary from that in the tissues. Therefore, more suitable effector concentration methods should be considered whenever available, possibly in the places where drug might meet cardiac ion channels (i.e., pericardial fluid, heart cell extracellular matrix, and cardiomyocyte cytoplasm). Something that is impossible in clinical practice can be potentially incorporated via the application of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation approach.

A total of 859 baseline profiles of testosterone from hypogonadal men were included in this analysis. The circadian rhythm of the testosterone was described by a stretched cosine function. Model parameters were estimated using NONMEM® 7.3. The effect of different covariates on the testosterone levels was investigated. Model evaluation was performed using non-parametric bootstrap and predictive checks. A stretched cosine function deeply improved the data goodness of fit compared to the standard trigonometric function (p < 0.001; ΔOFV = −204). The effect of the age and the semester, defined as winter and spring versus summer and fall, were significantly associated with the baseline levels of testosterone (p < 0.001, ΔOFV = −15.6, and p < 0.001, ΔOFV = −47.0). Model evaluation procedures such as diagnostic plots, visual predictive check, and non-parametric bootstrap evidenced that the proposed stretched cosine function was able to model the time course of the diurnal testosterone levels in hypogonadal males with accuracy and precision. The circadian rhythm of the testosterone levels was better predicted by the proposed stretched cosine function than a standard cosine function. Testosterone levels decreased by 5.74 ng/dL (2.4%) every 10 years and were 19.3 ng/dL (8.1%) higher during winter and spring compared to summer and fall.

INTRODUCTION
Testosterone affects almost every organ in the body (1). Functions of testosterone include promoting spermatogenesis, maintenance of accessory organs, muscle growth, development of secondary sexual characteristics, erythropoiesis, bone metabolism, and feedback to the hypothalamus–pituitary (2,3). The normal range for early morning total testosterone in healthy adult males ranges from approximately 300 to 1000 ng/dL (4,5). Low serum levels of total testosterone or hypogonadism (6) have been associated with a number of morbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, low muscle mass, low bone mass, low physical performance, and frailty (7).

Based on bioequivalence guidelines, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends a cutoff value of 250 ng/dL in order to define hypogonadism for clinical trial development and enrollment. In the present analysis, a mean threshold of 300 ng/dL was used to consider a subject as hypogonadal because it was the value used at screening in the available studies, which was in agreement with the common practice. Even though it has been widely discussed, the threshold to consider a subject as hypogonadal is a controversial issue, and different factors have to be considered in the diagnosis of hypogonadism (8). Since a diurnal pattern where the highest level is reached early in the morning is observed (9), hypogonadism diagnosis should be performed within the time period of 8:00–10:00 a.m. (10). Contrary to the substantial evidence for diurnal variation of testosterone, reproducible data demonstrating seasonal patterns of testosterone has been more elusive (11). While some studies suggest its effects (12), others have failed to replicate these results (13). Testosterone concentrations also change as a function of age (14). In healthy men and starting at the third decade of life, there is, on average, a decrease of 1–2% per year (15). Moreover, the prevalence of hypogonadism has recently increased (10). It has been reported that 12%, 19%, 28%, and 49% of men older than 50, 60, 70, or 80 years of age, respectively, suffer from hypogonadism (14). That is the reason why the use of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has increased by more than 43% from 2010 to 2013 (16). Historically, the pathway to approval for a TRT required pharmacokinetic but not clinical efficacy criteria (17). Present efficacy endpoints included a requirement that more than 75% of the men treated with TRT reach testosterone levels between the range of 300 and 1000 ng/dL.

The circadian pattern of testosterone has been extensively investigated in healthy males. For example, Gupta et al. (18) described the circadian rhythm of testosterone in healthy men; however, they were not able to describe a circadian behavior in hypogonadal men, most likely due to the use of samples after the administration of a transdermal system of testosterone. Moreover, in hypogonadal men, not only are the baseline values lower, but the amplitude of variation is also smaller and thus harder to characterize. Since testosterone is an endogenous substance with a circadian behavior, the assessment of the therapeutic effect of TRT results is challenging. To the best of our knowledge, no model has characterized the time course of the testosterone levels in hypogonadal men under “baseline” or pre-TRT conditions. It should be noted that the term “baseline” is used in the current paper to refer to the absence of TRT. A better understanding of the baseline testosterone kinetics in hypogonadal men would be useful to compare the efficacy between different TRT because the magnitude of the difference in the testosterone levels from the baseline could be considered as the therapeutic TRT effect.

Consequently, the main objective of this analysis was to build a population kinetic model to characterize the circadian rhythm of the baseline testosterone levels in hypogonadal men. This model would be used in the future to compare the efficacy of different TRT. The secondary objectives were to quantify the sources of variability and to explore the impact of patient characteristics on the testosterone kinetic parameters. In this paper, it will be demonstrated that a stretched cosine function is more appropriate to describe the circadian fluctuations in the testosterone levels than a standard cosine function. It will also be shown that the age of the patient and more importantly the time of year have an impact in the baseline levels of testosterone in hypogonadal men.

A total of 859 baseline or pre-dose profiles of testosterone from seven internal studies conducted in hypogonadal men were included in this analysis. Table I provides a summary of the subject demographics by study and overall. Usually, hypogonadism comes with a variety of other complications. Nevertheless, the patients included in these trials had no other medical condition. Subjects were included in these studies if they had mean serum concentrations of testosterone <300 ng/dL and an individual morning serum concentration ≤350 ng/dL, they were 18 years old or older, they had a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 37 kg/m2, and they provided their written informed consent The studies took place in Québec (studies 2–6), Montréal (studies 1–3), Toronto (study 1), North Carolina (studies 3 and 4), Florida (study 4), San Antonio (study 2), and Germany (study 7).Table I Summary of Hypogonadal Male Characteristics at Baseline Stratified by Clinical Study and Overall

Blood Sampling Schedule
Testosterone samples from studies 1 to 6 were analyzed by inVentiv Health while testosterone samples in study 7 were analyzed by Clinical Research Services Mannheim GmbH Bioanalytical Laboratory. All the samples were analyzed using a liquid chromatograph with a tandem mass spectrometry detector (LC/MS/MS method). The calibration range of the testosterone assay was 59.22–20,000 pg/mL. The accuracy ranged between 91.10% and 99.99% with a precision ranging between 1.68% and 66.07%. The lower limit of quantification was already provided in the calibration range (59.22 pg/mL).

Pharmacokinetic Model Development
Software
Testosterone concentration–time profiles were analyzed using the NONMEM® software (Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA), which included Version 7.3 installed on a Lenovo ThinkPad T430, equipped with processor Intel i7 3520M, running under Windows 7® 32 bits. Compilations were achieved using gfortran. Model parameters were estimated using stochastic approximation expectation maximization (SAEM) algorithm while standard errors were computed using the Monte Carlo importance sampling (IMP) method. Graphical and all other statistical analyses, including evaluation of NONMEM® outputs, were performed using R version 3.1.0 running under the Rstudio interface.

Structural Model
The circadian rhythm of testosterone levels was described using a standard cosine function according to Eq. 1: 1 Circadian(t)=Amplitude⋅cos(2π⋅(t−Phase)24) where Amplitude represents the oscillation in the testosterone levels, t represents the time, and Phase represents the time at which the peak is achieved.

The complete time course of the testosterone levels was characterized by the addition of a Base parameter to the circadian function according to Eq. 2: 2 Testosterone(t)=Circadian(t)+Base where Base represents the baseline levels of testosterone.

Statistical Model
Visual inspection of individual concentration–time profile suggested interindividual variability. Between-subject or interindividual variability (IIV) in a kinetic parameter, P, was included in the model, and it was assumed to be log-normally distributed as shown in Eq. 3: 3 Pj=P*eηj where Pj is the individual kinetic parameter for the jth individual, P* is the typical value of the kinetic parameter in the population, and ηj is the parameter quantifying the deviation of the individual parameter from the typical value. ηj was assumed to have zero mean and variance ωP2. The magnitude of IIV was expressed as coefficient of variation (CV) calculated as the square root of ωP2.

Residual variability was evaluated using a proportional error model according to Eq. 4: 4 Tobs=Tpred⋅1+ε where Tobs is the observed testosterone level, Tpred is the corresponding model prediction, and ε is a parameter quantifying the residual variability, assumed to follow an independent Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance σ2.

Model Selection Criteria
To identify the best statistical model, a series of models were evaluated. For each model, the improvement in the fit obtained was assessed by the likelihood ratio test (LRT) (p = 0.001), the reduction in the IIV and residual variability, the precision in parameter estimates, the examination of diagnostic plots, and the shrinkage (19).

Covariate Analysis
The effect of age, body weight, body mass index (BMI), height, ethnicity, season, and semester was explored as sources of IIV on the testosterone kinetic parameters. In order to investigate a possible seasonal effect, season was defined as a covariate with four categories: winter, spring, summer, and fall. Winter, spring, summer, and fall were considered from December 21st to March 19th, from March 20th to June 19th, from June 20th to September 21st, and from September 22nd to December 20th, respectively. Semester was split into two subcovariates. On the one hand, semester 1 was defined as a dichotomous variable with a value of 0, if summer or fall, and a value of 1, if winter or spring. On the other hand, semester 2 was defined as a dichotomous variable with a value of 0, if spring or summer, and a value of 1, if fall or winter. Similarly, ethnicity was defined as a value of 0 for Hispanic or Latino and a value of 1 for non-Hispanic nor Latino. Race was not evaluated because its categories were unbalanced. A screening analysis was conducted only on the kinetic parameters where the shrinkage was lower than 0.3 and was based on visual graphical inspection and stepwise linear regression of the relationships between the individual Bayesian kinetic parameters and the covariates. Only covariates with statistically significant (p < 0.05) and potentially clinically relevant (r2 > 0.2) effect on kinetic parameters in the screening analysis were further tested one by one in NONMEM® in order to be incorporated in the population model.

The effect of selected covariates on model parameters was explored following the forward-inclusion (p < 0.005) and backward-elimination (p < 0.001) process as described elsewhere (20). With this methodology, only covariates showing significant contributions were kept in the population model. Categorical covariates were incorporated into the model as index variables, whereas continuous covariates were included using linear equations after centering on the median.

Model Evaluation
A visual predictive check was made using the technique described by Yano et al. (21). The parameter estimates obtained by fitting the selected population kinetic model to the data were used to simulate the population kinetic profile of the testosterone levels. Using model predictions, a non-parametric 90% prediction interval around the observed testosterone levels was constructed to quantify the variability in the model predictions. Furthermore, normalized prediction distribution error (NPDE) was also assessed (22). If the model adequately describes the data, NPDE should follow a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. Finally, a non-parametric bootstrap was used as internal evaluation method to qualify the estimates of the model parameters (23). The mean and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the parameter estimates from the bootstrap replicates were compared with the estimated parameters from the original dataset.

RESULTS
The dataset analyzed in this study included seven internal studies conducted at inVentiv Health. The model fitted a total of 859 baseline profiles of testosterone consisting of 4556 observations. Table I summarizes the characteristics of the patients included in this study. The internal model evaluations were conducted under the same dataset. Model parameters were estimated using SAEM algorithm followed by IMP method in order to compute the standard error and to obtain a value of the objective function to compare between models.

A standard cosine function provided a reasonable description of the time course of the baseline testosterone levels. However, the plot of the testosterone levels versus time (Fig. 1) revealed that after the morning peak, the decrease in the testosterone levels is faster than the increase from the nadir. This fact suggests an asymmetric circadian rhythm of testosterone. Consequently, a stretched cosine function was proposed. This function allows the time between the peak of testosterone (tmax) and the nadir (tmin) to be different from 12 h in order to capture this non-symmetric behavior. This equation has several components according to Eqs. (5–7): 5 t24=t−tmaxmod24 where t24 is a vector of the difference between time t and tmaxmodulo 24 h, that is, limited to a 24-h interval. 6 L1=tmin−tmaxmod24 where L1 is the length of the first interval, in other words the time that it takes from the peak of testosterone to the nadir modulo 24 h as well.Fig. 1 Time course of the baseline testosterone levels in hypogonadal men. Gray points represent observations. The blue line represents the smooth regression line

 7 L2=24−L1 

L2 represents the length of the second interval, and thus, the stretch of the cosine function (τ) can be defined as shown in Eq. 8: 8 τift24≤L1thenτ=12L1t24ift24>L1thenτ=12+12L2t24−L1 

The new parameters to be estimated were tmax and tmin instead of the phase shift, and as can be observed, τ depends on tmax, tmin, and t. Therefore, the asymmetric circadian rhythm can be defined according to Eq. 9: 9 Circadian(t)=Amplitude⋅cos(2π⋅τ24) 

This parameterization had a major impact in the objective function value (OFV), which decreases by 84 points compared to the standard trigonometric function. Also, compared to a double cosine function, the decrease was 40 points.

Moreover, the goodness of fit was further improved by the inclusion of IIV in tmax (∆OFV = −49.9), tmin (∆OFV = −196), Amplitude (∆OFV = −125), and Base (∆OFV = −3980). However, etabar problems in Base were noticed. In this sense, the histograms and density plots of the distribution of the eta values in Base brought to light a certain degree of skewness. Consequently, a Box–Cox transformation in ηBase was implemented as described in Eq. 10: 10 ηBase=((eηBase)θ1−1)θ1 where θ1 is a parameter to be estimated characterizing the skewness of the distribution. Under this codification, the etabar problems disappeared and a significant reduction in the OFV was achieved (∆OFV = −107). Moreover, at the first stage of the modeling, independence between the interindividual random effects was assumed. However, the graphical and statistical explorations of the correlations among the IIV terms revealed a potential association between tmax and tmin and between Amplitude and Base. The correlations between these parameters were further evaluated in NONMEM® by estimating the non-diagonal elements of the variance–covariance matrix for the between-subject random effects. The estimation of the off-diagonal elements of the omega correlation matrix further improved the model fit to the data (∆OFV = −150). For this model, the shrinkage of the interindividual random effects of tmax, tmin, Amplitude, and Base was 61%, 47%, 29%, and 4%, respectively.

The next step in the model building process was the covariate analysis. Height was not tested because it was included in the computation of the BMI. Out of 859 subjects enrolled in this analysis, 778 (90.6%) were white or Caucasian. Consequently, race was not evaluated because its categories were not balanced. Scatterplots (for continuous) or boxplots (for categorical) of the interindividual random effects versus covariates were created in those parameters where the shrinkage was lower than 0.3 (Amplitude and Base). This graphical analysis reveals a slight trend between the baseline and the age (Fig. 2a) and between the baseline and the semester (winter and spring vs summer and fall) (Fig. 2b). The inclusion of the effect of age and semester on Base improved the model fit to the data and decreased the OFV in a significant extent (∆OFV = −15.6 and ∆OFV = −47.0, respectively). Age and semester explained 2.5% and 3.4% of the variability in the baseline values of testosterone. The search for sources of IIV in those parameters where the shrinkage was higher than 0.3 (tmax and tmin) was conducted with a formal analysis in NONMEM® after exploring all the combinations. No additional covariates other than the age and the season were found to explain IIV in any parameter nor improved the model fit to the data. Consequently, the model described was considered the best model to describe the time course of the baseline levels in hypogonadal men.Fig. 2

Plots of observations versus population (Fig. 3a) and individual (Fig. 3b) predicted concentration, and conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) versus observations (Fig. 3c) and versus time (Fig. 3d) showed random uniform scatter around the identity line, indicating the absence of bias while histograms of CWRES (Fig. 3e) and NPDE (Fig. 3f) exhibited centered distribution around 0. The parameter estimates and their associated precisions, measured as relative standard error (RSE), for the best model are presented in Table III. All structural model parameters, or fixed effects, were estimated with good precision (RSE < 33%), and random effects were estimated with very good precision (RSE < 17%).Fig. 3 Diagnostic plots of the model developed to characterize testosterone kinetics in hypogonadal men.

The results of the visual predictive check performed are presented in Fig. 4. In this plot, the blue lines represent the percentiles 5th, 50th, and 95th based on the model predictions and the shaded gray area between them represents the 90% prediction interval (PI). For each of these percentiles, a 95% PI was constructed (dotted blue lines around these percentiles). The vertical dotted lines represent the selected bins. For each bin, the percentiles 5th, 50th, and 95th based on the observations were computed and plotted on top of model prediction (horizontal blue solid lines), in order to visually compare the variability in the model predictions. Besides, the percentage of observations below the percentiles 5th, 50th, and 95th was computed and plotted on the right margin of the plot. In this sense, 6.5%, 47.4%, and 95.1% of the observations were below the theoretical 5%, 50%, and 95%. This figure evidences that the population kinetic model developed was deeply appropriate to characterize the time course of the baseline testosterone levels in hypogonadal men. Furthermore, the mean of NPDE was 0.019 (95% CI −0.011, 0.044) and the value of the standard deviation was 0.986 (95% CI 0.964, 1.008).Fig. 4 Visual predictive check of the model developed to characterize the time course of the testosterone levels in hypogonadal men.

Non-parametric bootstrap analysis was also used as an internal model evaluation technique to qualify the developed model. From the 1000 bootstrap replicates, 0 (0%) failed to minimize successfully. The analysis of the results from the 1000 bootstrap replicates that minimized successfully is provided in Table III. The population estimates for the final model were very similar to the mean of the 1000 bootstrap replicates, and were contained within the 95% confidence intervals obtained from the bootstrap analysis. Besides the accuracy, the precision of the NONMEM® parameter estimates was also good, because the relative standard error from the bootstrap analysis for the fixed and random effects were lower than 14% and 3%, respectively. Overall, the validation results are satisfactory for this dataset.

DISCUSSION
The primary goal of this analysis was to build a population kinetic model in order to characterize the circadian rhythm of the baseline testosterone levels in hypogonadal men. A stretched cosine function was used to describe the non-symmetric behavior in the circadian rhythm of the testosterone levels. According to the estimated model parameters, the time that it takes from the peak of testosterone to the nadir was estimated to be around 5 h. This means that after reaching the nadir, the increase until the new peak is much slower (approximately 19 h). In this sense, it was estimated that the peak of testosterone occurs around 9:20 in the morning, which is consistent with the clinical practice for the diagnosis of hypogonadism (10). In this study, a cutoff of 300 ng/dL was used to consider a subject with low levels of testosterone. Accordingly, the base value of testosterone in hypogonadal men was estimated to be 239 ng/dL. Moreover, the amplitude of the oscillation was estimated to be 32.4 ng/dL, with an associated IIV higher than 50%. Therefore, the modeled typical hypogonadal patient would always be considered as a hypogonadal subject, even at the peak testosterone concentration.

During the model building process, a Box–Cox transformation was implemented because etabar problems in the Base parameter were noticed. In population modeling, it is commonly assumed that eta parameters follow a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of ω2. However, this is not always true as reported by Petterson et al. (24). The authors’ suggested some transformation to relax the often erroneous assumption of a known shape of the parameter distribution. In our model, the additional parameter estimated required for the Box–Cox transformation was close to a value of −2, indicating negative skewness.

Within the range of values analyzed, body weight, ethnicity, and smoke did not influence the circadian rhythm of testosterone to a significant extent. However, an increase in age was associated with a decrement in the baseline values of testosterone. Concretely, it was estimated that during a 10-year span, the baseline concentration of testosterone would be 5.74 ng/dL lower at the end of the period compared to the beginning. These results are in concordance with the known decrease in the testosterone levels with age (15). More interesting was the fact that a seasonal effect was demonstrated. Baseline testosterone levels were 8.09% higher during the winter and spring compared to the summer and fall. This difference might be clinically relevant because, on average, a difference of 19.3 ng/dL is expected between seasons. These results are in accordance with the findings of Svartberg et al. (12). Effectively, in a study conducted in Norway, these authors observed that free testosterone levels showed a significant seasonal pattern (P < 0.001), with the peak in December and the nadir in August. Lowest testosterone levels occurred in months with the highest temperatures and longest hours of daylight. In our study, one explanation of the seasonal effect might be the variations in temperature and daylight in the provinces of Québec and Ontario, Canada, where the studies mainly took place. The average temperatures in this area during winter and spring are much lower than during the summer and fall, and also, on average, the days are around 150 min shorter in terms of sunlight. In this sense, it has been observed that lower temperatures stimulate the pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) during “cold” seasons (25). Besides, the peak of LH and FSH occurs in March and February, respectively. It is also known that physiologically, FSH and LH stimulate the testes to synthesize testosterone and, consequently, the authors’ hypothesis that the seasonal effect on the baseline values of testosterone was due to an indirect effect because of the low temperatures and the shorter hours of daylight. However, this effect might not be observed in other parts of the world where the temperature variations are not as important as in the northern countries.

Model-based simulations of the time course of the testosterone levels for young (27.9 years old) and old (70.7 years old) subjects during winter and spring and summer and fall are presented in Fig. 5. These simulations are presented together with the time course of testosterone levels in the typical young and old healthy subjects based on the model developed by Gupta et al. (18). Both models predict similar patterns with higher testosterone peaks early during the morning and nadir levels during the afternoon and evening. As expected, the simulations evidenced that lower levels of testosterone would be easier observed in an old subject compared to a young subject. Moreover, one subject would be more likely diagnosed as hypogonadal during summer and fall compared to winter and spring. Furthermore, it should be noted that the testosterone levels of a young hypogonadal male during summer and fall will be similar to the levels of an old hypogonadal male during winter and spring. The simulations also evidence that a fast decrease in the testosterone levels occurs after the testosterone peak. This fact might show the clinicians the optimal time for the TRT to be administrated in order to maintain the testosterone levels within the normal range of 300 and 1000 ng/dL.Fig. 5 Simulation of the time course of the testosterone levels based on typical patient values. The horizontal black dashed line represents the threshold for hypogonadism (300 ng/dL)



Visual predictive check, normalized predictive distribution errors, and non-parametric bootstrap were used as complementary tools to internally evaluate the model developed. The bootstrap analyses conducted in the current study yielded mean model parameters that were comparable to the estimates of the original data set, indicating the stability of the developed model. These findings were further supported by the predictive checks performed, which confirmed the model developed was suitable to describe the time course of testosterone levels in hypogonadal men. As a result, the efficacy between different TRT can be assessed by the proposed model described above. Effectively, the time course of the testosterone levels in hypogonadal men depending on the age and the season of the year can be simulated from our model. These profiles can be compared with the profiles after the administration of TRT, and thus, the therapeutic effect of different TRT would be easily evaluated. Moreover, because of the use of a stretched cosine function, it can be known that the lowest values of testosterone after the peak occur faster than a 12-h interval. Therefore, a more accurate dose regimen can be proposed to minimize the impact of the circadian behavior of testosterone in hypogonadal men.

In summary, we demonstrated that a stretched cosine function where the circadian rhythm was considered to be asymmetric was the most suitable function to describe the circadian behavior of the baseline testosterone levels in hypogonadal men. The proposed stretched cosine function might also be useful in all those situations where a non-symmetric circadian rhythm is observed in order to improve model predictions. Age and season were identified as predictors of the baseline testosterone levels. The present model manages to well characterize the population and individual kinetics of the testosterone levels, making it suitable to compare the efficacy between different TRT.

Accurate quantification of DDIs is therefore crucial but may be difficult when full concentration-time profiles are problematic to obtain. We have compared non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and model-based predictions of DDIs for long half-life drugs by conducting simulation studies and reviewing published trials, using antituberculosis drug bedaquiline (BDQ) as a model compound. Furthermore, different DDI study designs were evaluated. A sequential design mimicking conducted trials and a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of BDQ and the M2 metabolite were utilized in the simulations where five interaction scenarios from strong inhibition (clearance fivefold decreased) to strong induction (clearance fivefold increased) were evaluated. In trial simulations, NCA systematically under-predicted the DDIs’ impact. The bias in average exposure was 29–96% for BDQ and 20–677% for M2. The model-based analysis generated unbiased predictions, and simultaneous fitting of metabolite data increased precision in DDI predictions. The discrepancy between the methods was also apparent for conducted trials, e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir was predicted to increased BDQ exposure 22% by NCA and 188% by model-based methods. In the design evaluation, studies with parallel designs were considered and shown to generally be inferior to sequential/cross-over designs. However, in the case of low inter-individual variability and no informative metabolite data, a prolonged parallel design could be favored. Model-based analysis for DDI assessments is preferable over NCA for victim drugs with a long half-life and should always be used when incomplete concentration-time profiles are part of the analysis.

INTRODUCTION
Simultaneous administration of multiple drugs is a common practice in current medicine, for instance, in the case of polypharmacy among the elderly or in the treatment of infectious diseases such as HIV and/or tuberculosis, each of which require a combination therapy with three or more compounds to achieve stable cure and avoid the emergence of resistance. When multiple drugs are administered simultaneously, clinically important drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may occur (1–4). Pharmacokinetic (PK) DDIs, which are the focus of this study, can result in undesirably low or high levels of drug exposure yielding the treatment either inefficacious or toxic. An accurate estimate of the impact of the DDI on drug exposures is therefore essential to first of all assess the need for dose adjustment and then to make dose adjustment recommendations.

PK DDIs are traditionally evaluated in single-dose studies with cross-over or sequential designs where the PK of the victim drug (the drug of primary interest) after administration with and without the perpetrator drug (the drug potentially impacting the victim drug) are compared, as described in the regulatory guidelines from EMA and FDA (5,6). PK parameters of interest (area under the concentration curve [AUC] and Cmax) are commonly derived with non-compartmental analysis (NCA), and the DDI is expressed as a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of these parameters. However, this approach becomes problematic when the elimination half-life of the drug of interest is exceedingly long since this may lead to infeasibly long wash-out periods, carry-over between the dosing occasions, impractical and expensive long sampling periods, and/or incomplete capturing of the full concentration-time profile.

Bedaquiline (BDQ) is a new antituberculosis drug with multi-phasic elimination and a terminal elimination half-life of more than 5 months (7). BDQ is mainly metabolized through N-demethylation catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme (CYP3A4) forming the metabolite M2, which in turn can be metabolized by the same process into M3 (7). M2 is less active than BDQ but has been linked to potential safety concerns (7). Urinary excretion of BDQ is negligible; fecal excretion occurs but the extent is unknown (7,8).

Since tuberculosis is always treated with a combination therapy regimen and a large part of patients receive concomitant antiretroviral treatment due to HIV co-infection (9) (e.g., 32% of the 1.1 million TB patients with HIV co-infection were started on antiretroviral therapy globally in 2013 and the number is increasing (10)), correct assessment of DDIs is essential for efficient and safe application of BDQ. A number of DDI studies have been conducted and analyzed with both traditional NCA and model-based population PK methods, with the results differing substantially between the two methods for some studies (11–16). The objective of the current study was to compare NCA and model-based predictions of DDIs in conducted trials with BDQ and in a simulation study with BDQ as a model for long half-life drugs and to investigate how various study designs influence the bias and precision of DDI assessments. This study will provide general recommendations for study design and analysis methods to generate accurate predictions of DDIs involving a compound with long half-life to support future regulatory guidance.

METHODS
Population PK Model
A previously published population model describing the PK of BDQ and M2 was used as the basis for the simulation study (14). The model was developed using data from a phase I DDI study with sequential design including 35 subjects investigating the influence of efavirenz on BDQ and M2 PK. Plasma concentrations for PK analysis were measured over 2 weeks after a single 400-mg BDQ dose was administrated, which was followed by a wash-out period of 2 weeks when daily administration of 600 mg efavirenz was initiated and maintained throughout the study. Four weeks after the first dose, a second 400-mg BDQ dose was administered (together with efavirenz), and BDQ and M2 concentrations were again measured over the following 2 weeks. Each observation period included one pre-dose sample and 16 samples between 1 and 336 h post-dose with closer observations in the early part of the period. The developed population model included a dynamic transit-compartment structure describing the absorption and three and two compartments for the disposition of BDQ and M2, respectively. The bioavailability and fraction BDQ metabolized to M2 were set to 1 in the model; hence, estimated parameters are relative to the bioavailability and for the metabolite also to the fraction BDQ metabolized to M2 (fm). Allometric scaling with body weight was included in the model. The model was implemented in NONMEM 7.3 (17) and utilized the first-order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI). Supplementary Material 1 includes a schematic figure of the model structure and model parameter estimates.

Posterior Predictive Check
The suitability of the model and study design for the simulations mimicking DDI studies was evaluated with posterior predictive check (PPC) methodology (18). Secondary PK parameters estimated with NCA using the originally observed data were compared with the same parameters estimated from a large number (n = 1000) of datasets simulated with the model. The study design, PK sampling schedule, and the weight characteristics of the subjects were the same in the simulations as in the original study. The R-package ncappc (19–21) and the nca functionality in PsN were utilized for this task (22,23). The parameter of main interest was GMR based on AUC0–336 h. In addition to the study of DDI with efavirenz, the same evaluation was conducted on models with the same structure describing the DDIs with nevirapine, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, rifampicin, and rifapentine (15,16). The previously performed clinical studies were conducted in accordance with GCP and local ethical guidelines.

Simulation Study of DDI Predictions
The same study design and sampling strategy as in the original study were used (see original publication for details (11) and the sequential design in Fig. 1 for an overview). The number of subjects and their weight characteristics were also unaltered. Five hypothetical but realistic DDI scenarios were chosen: inhibition of BDQ clearance (CL) to 20 or 50% of normal, no interaction effect, and induction of BBQ CL to 200 or 500% of normal. The interaction effect on M2 CL was set to the same magnitude as on BDQ CL. Inter-individual variability (IIV) in interaction effect on BDQ and M2 was 20–30% and the correlation was 75%, consistent with the earlier estimates for the effect of efavirenz (14). The interaction effects were set to have full impact on CL from 1 week before the second BDQ dose, corresponding to the administration of an inhibitor starting that same day or an inducer about 1 week earlier. One hundred trials for each scenario were simulated, and the data were analyzed with NCA and by re-estimation of all model parameters, including two separate parameters for the interaction effects on BDQ and M2. Prediction of the impact of the interaction by NCA was defined as the GMR of AUC0–336 h and for the model-based method as the relative average concentration at steady state (relCavg,ss, identical to the ratio of weekly AUC at steady state with and without interaction effect) calculated from estimated apparent CLs with and without interaction effect (IE) (Eq. 1).Fig. 1 Schematic illustration of study designs (Seq sequential, Par1 parallel 1, Par2 parallel 2) evaluated for prediction of DDIs for a drug with a long half-life

The estimated CLapparent corresponds to CL/F for BDQ and CL(M2)/(F * fm) for M2. The predictions from the two methods were compared with the true relCavg,ss for BDQ and M2 under the given DDI scenario and bias (reported as %) was calculated as the difference between predicted and the true relative to the true.

Use of Metabolite Data
For the original BDQ and efavirenz study and for each of the simulated scenarios described above, an alternative model describing only BDQ PK was estimated excluding the metabolite data. The precision (relative standard error, RSE) in the parameter describing the interaction effect on BDQ for the models including both BDQ and M2 data and the models including BDQ data only were compared.

Alternative Study Designs
Three study designs were investigated (Fig. 1).A sequential design including 16 subjects with two BDQ doses administered 4 weeks apart; the second dose was administered preceded by and together with the interacting drug, 2 weeks of PK sampling after each dose (similar to the design used in conducted BDQ DDI studies).

A parallel design including 32 individuals, 16 in each of the two groups, where a single BDQ dose was administered with or without interacting drug and PK sampling over 2 weeks.

A parallel design including 16 individuals, 8 in each of the two groups, where a single BDQ dose was administered with or without interacting drug and PK sampling over 6 weeks.

All three designs included an equal number of samples. The groups in the parallel designs were matched on body weight. Three DDI scenarios were chosen: inhibition of BDQ CL to 20% of normal, no interaction effect, and induction of BDQ CL to 500% of normal. For each DDI scenario, three different PK scenarios were evaluated: (i) IIV in BDQ and M2 clearances and interaction effects as estimated originally (24, 19, 21, and 28% coefficient of variation [CV], respectively) (called “Original”); (ii) 50% CV in BDQ and M2 clearances and IIV in the interaction effects on BDQ and M2 as estimated originally (called “High CL IIV”); and (ii) IIV of BDQ and M2 clearances as estimated originally and 50% CV in the interaction effects on BDQ and M2 (called “High IE IIV”). Correlation structures and magnitudes mimicked what has earlier been estimated for induction and inhibition effects, respectively. One hundred trials for each scenario (n = 9) were simulated and analyzed with NCA and model-based re-estimation of all parameters. In the NCA analysis, GMRs were calculated from both AUC0–336 h and AUC0–inf including an extrapolated area calculated from the last observation and the estimated terminal half-life. The terminal half-life was estimated from the slope of a regression line fitted to n last observations where the number n was determined by the adjusted regression coefficient. The re-estimation was conducted both including all data (two separate parameters for interaction effect on BDQ and M2) and including only the BDQ data.



RESULTS
Posterior Predictive Check
The results from the PPC are summarized in Table I. The GMRs calculated by NCA on the observed data generally agree well with the median of the GMRs calculated on simulated data and falls within the 95% confidence intervals for all five evaluated DDIs and both BDQ and M2. Hence, the model is able to generate data in good agreement with the observed data and is suitable for use in simulation studies.Table I Summary of Results from Posterior Predictive Checks Comparing GMRs Calculated on NCA Derived AUC0–336 h for BDQ and M2, Respectively, with Different Perpetrator Dugs

Simulation Study of DDI Predictions
Figure 2 illustrates the DDI predictions by NCA and model-based estimation, for BDQ and M2, respectively, in relation to the true RelCavg,ss for the given magnitude of the DDI applied in the simulation. For both induction and inhibition, the magnitude of the DDIs’ impact is under-predicted by NCA GMRs; more severely so for the metabolite. The bias was 29–96 and 20–677% for BDQ and M2, respectively, in the different scenarios. The model-based estimation accurately predicted the DDIs’ impact for both BDQ and M2 (bias was 0.1–1.1 and 1.1–4.9%, respectively), but with lower precision for the strong inhibition.Fig. 2 Comparison of DDI predictions from NCA (y-axis) and model-based analysis (x-axis) for the five simulated scenarios. The gray lines represent the true relative average steady-state concentrations (relC
avg,ss) for each scenario. The results are presented as median and inter-quartile range



Use of Metabolite Data
The precision in the estimated DDI parameter was markedly better when both parent and the metabolite data were used in the estimation (Fig. 3). In the simulation study, RSEs were between two and six times higher when the information from the metabolite data was excluded. For the observed data, the RSE was increased fivefold.Fig. 3 Precision of model-based DDI predictions quantified as relative standard error (RSE) of the estimate of the parameter describing DDI effect on BDQ from the 100 simulated trials for each scenario when including both BDQ and M2 data (red bars) or BDQ data only (blue bars)



Alternative Study Designs
The model-based analysis generated accurate predictions of the interaction effect for all study designs and under all scenarios (Fig. 4). Generally, the sequential design resulted in the best precision with a larger gain in the scenario with higher CL IIV but little or no gain in the scenario with high interaction effect IIV. When parallel design was used, the precision was generally better in the design with standard length of the sampling period but more subjects (parallel 1) compared to the design with standard number of subjects but longer sampling period (parallel 2). However, when the estimation was conducted without the metabolite data, the parallel design with longer sampling period (parallel 2) generally performed best of all three designs, indicating the benefit of longer sampling to accurately estimate the BDQ clearance in the absence of metabolite data (Supplementary Material 2). The NCA-derived GMRs based on either AUC0–336 h or AUC0–inf failed to reflect the true impact of the simulated induction and inhibition in each PK scenario (Fig. 5). AUC0–inf generally came closer to the true value although the uncertainty of the extrapolation was large. The problem caused by carry-over between the doses was evident for the sequential design in the case of no interaction and GMR based on AUC0–336 h. The parallel design with long sampling period came closer to the true values than the parallel design with increased number of subjects; however, it was less precise. The level of IIV of clearances or interaction effect had little impact on the NCA results.Fig. 4 Box plots of model-based estimation of interaction effect (factor change in CL) for the different designs (Seq sequential, Par1 parallel 1, Par2 parallel 2), the different PK scenarios (original, high CL IIV, and high IE IIV), and the different interaction effect scenarios (induction, no interaction, and inhibition)

DISCUSSION
The conducted simulation study clearly demonstrates that NCA-derived GMRs underestimate the full impact of a DDI for a victim drug with long half-life (Fig. 2). The predictions are even more biased for the metabolite compared to the parent compound. The reasons are several and will be discussed in detail below. Firstly, the whole concentration-time curve could not be characterized. For BDQ, the 2 weeks of observations after each dose were not enough to observe the major part of the total AUC. Table II summarizes the estimates of the fraction observed based on model-derived AUC0–336 h and AUC0–inf. In the absence of any interaction effect, about half of the total AUC was observed for BDQ and less than a third for M2. Hence, a substantial part of the elimination phase was ignored when GMRs based on AUC0–336 h were used to predict the impact of a DDI, consequently resulting in the under-prediction of any DDI affecting the elimination. Furthermore, the fraction of the total AUC that can be observed during a fixed time period changes with the interaction effect. The GMRs will therefore compare a smaller with a larger fraction of the total AUC or vice versa. For example, in the case of inhibition when BDQ CL is decreased to half of its normal value, 31% of total AUC would be observed over 2 weeks and compared with 48% of total AUC observed over the same time period without interaction effect. This will further bias the prediction, aggravate the under-prediction in the case of inhibition, and somewhat counteract the under-prediction in the case of induction. Calculation of GMRs based on NCA-derived AUC0–inf did unfortunately not improve the predictions substantially either. To estimate a terminal half-life known to be longer than 5 months on 2 weeks observations after a single dose using NCA is bound to be extremely uncertain. In the simulation examples, the NCA estimates of terminal half-life were around a few hundred hours, which is about ten times lower than the true value, resulting in incorrect extrapolation and little improvements in the GMRs. The predictions for the metabolite suffer from the same limitations as for the parent drug and, in addition, the added complexity that both input rate and elimination are affected. For induction affecting clearance of both parent and metabolite, more metabolite appears early during the observation period. It may therefore seem as exposure is increasing (as it does in the simulated scenario where CL of BDQ and M2 is increased to the double, see Fig. 2), despite that the true total exposure would be half of the normal exposure in the absence of any interaction effect.Table II Summary of Observed Fraction (%) of Total AUC of BDQ and M2 Observed During a 2-Week Sampling Period for the Different Interaction Scenarios

The model-based analysis accurately predicted DDI effects using a model parameterized as the parent being fully metabolized through the pathway affected by the interaction. Although the model is formulated under this assumption, it is valid for any fraction of the parent CL being induced or inhibited and will correctly predict the changes in exposure since that is determined by the total CL which is captured by the model. However, if the fraction of the parent metabolized through the induced/inhibited pathway is less than one, the interpretation of the estimated interaction effect on CL (IEapparent) does not reflect the change in the pathway associated with the interaction. Rather, the fractional change in the associated pathway (IEspecific) can be obtained from Eq. 2, where fm is the fraction metabolized through the pathway in question in the absence of any interaction effect. 2 IEspecific=IEapparent+fm−1fm 

For inhibitors, some conclusions can often be drawn about the importance of the pathway in question from the value of the IEapparent. For the metabolite, the implemented model assumes that all eliminated parent is forming the measured metabolite and that all metabolite are eliminated through a pathway affected by the interaction. As for the parent compound, the model will correctly predict change in the exposure of the metabolite even if either or both of these assumptions are violated, but again, the interpretation of the estimated parameters will change. Additional discussion about the interpretation of the metabolite’s parameters and the relative magnitudes of BDQ’s and M2’s clearance pathways given the observed results in published DDI studies can be found in Supplementary Material 3.

An awareness of the poorly predicted terminal half-life and a general reluctance to use AUC0–inf when the extrapolated area forms a large part of the total area are probably the reasons why all published NCA predictions of DDIs with BDQ and M2 have used AUC0–336 h (7,11,12). The summary in Table III compares NCA and model-based DDI predictions and shows that NCA consistently predicts lower impact of the DDI than model-based analysis. The largest discrepancy is observed for the strong inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir where NCA predicts a 22% increase in BDQ exposure while model-based analysis predicts an increase of 188%. These two predictions may produce a different outcome in a discussion about the clinical importance of the DDI and the need for a dose adjustment. It is also striking that NCA predicts M2 exposure to decrease more than 40% during co-administration with lopinavir/ritonavir, although inhibition of CYP3A4 is expected to affect M2 clearance and exposure therefore should increase. Recently conducted DDI studies in patients on long-term BDQ treatment with concomitant antiretroviral are expected to provide further insight in the predictive accuracy of these two methods. Preliminary results show a twofold increase in BDQ exposure when administered together with lopinavir/ritonavir but no significant change in M2 exposure (24). However, the interpretation of the presented results is difficult since sampling was conducted somewhere between week 3 and 24 of BDQ treatment, and it is expected that accumulation over time of treatment would make average concentrations of BDQ and M2 over that time period vary substantially (15).Table III Comparison of Previous Published NCA and Model-Based DDI Predictions for BDQ and M2

BDQ which was used as an example in this work has indeed extreme PK characteristics, and the results presented here may represent one of the worst-case scenarios. However, there are numerous other drugs with very long half-life, examples are mefloquine 14–41 days (25), amiodarone 21–78 days (26), and oritavancin 393 h (27). Furthermore, what can be called “long half-life” is always relative to the length of the sampling period. In a recent DDI study, conducted in healthy volunteers, investigating the antimalarial drugs cipargamin and piperaquine (terminal half-life ~22 days) PK samples had to be collected over 60 days after a single dose which is impractical but necessary since NCA was used for the interpretation (28). The problems presented for the BDQ example will occur for any drug in any situation where it is impossible or undesirable to sample long enough to observe the majority of the total AUC. Our conclusions regarding NCA’s inability to generate accurate predictions are therefore more widely applicable and should be considered at least for any drug with half-life longer than the intended sampling period.

Measuring metabolite concentrations contributes to the ability to characterize the clearance of the parent compound in a model-based analysis since the formation of the metabolite is linked to the clearance of the parent. Thereby metabolite observations also contribute to the characterization of DDIs as shown by the increased RSE in the interaction effect parameter in our simulations when metabolite data was excluded (Fig. 3). There are also examples in the literature where simultaneous modeling of parent and metabolite data has aided characterization of DDIs, e.g., the effect of ketoconazole and rifampin on ifosfamide, the effect of zosuquidar trihydrochloride on doxorubicin, or the effect of ritonavir on nelfinavir (29–31). We suggest that it could be of interest to measure metabolite concentrations, when a metabolite with relevant exposure levels exists, even in situations where the metabolite is not active or important for safety reasons. This is expected to increase the precision in the predictions which means that a study with a smaller sample size may be sufficient to predict the impact of the interaction with retained power, which in turn is beneficial from both ethical and economic perspectives.

Parallel study designs instead of cross-over or sequential designs have been suggested as options for drugs with long half-life in order to avoid carry-over. Our simulations demonstrate that overcoming the problem of carry-over still does not render NCA-derived predictions accurate (Supplementary Material 2); however, longer sampling periods do bring the predictions closer to the truth. A parallel design with longer sampling could therefore be preferred over a cross-over/sequential if NCA methodology has to be used and could potentially generate accurate predictions provided that a high enough percentage of the total AUC is observed and/or for weaker interaction effects. Correcting the AUC observed on the second occasion in a cross-over/sequential study for the carry-over by subtracting an extrapolated AUC is problematic since the terminal half-life is poorly estimated and the correction may not be reliable. For the model-based analysis, where carry-over does not necessarily introduce bias, the study design does not impact the accuracy and the precision of the DDI prediction substantially when the IIV of the clearance of the victim drug is relatively low (Fig. 4). However, when the IIV of the clearance of the victim drug is as high as 50% CV, precision is lost in the parallel designs. We therefore support the continued used of cross-over or sequential study designs when the study is intended for model-based analysis.

Moving from single-dose DDI studies to multiple-dose studies and observing PK of the victim drug as steady state could provide a situation where NCA would generate more accurate DDI predictions for drugs with a long half-life. Such designs are likely to be costly due to the study length (prolonged dosing to reach steady-state concentrations needed). Further, protracted exposure to a study drug that will persist in the circulation for a long period of time may be undesirable, particularly if the drug has clinically important toxicities. The mentioned disadvantages make single-dose designs and model-based analysis a more appealing option, at least as long as linear PK of the victim drug can be assumed.

The simulation studies show that population PK methods can provide accurate DDI predictions with good precision for drugs with long half-life where NCA methods fail. These simulation studies further demonstrate that metabolite data can be used in the modeling to increase the knowledge gained from the study. Another benefit of the model-based analysis is that it enables a more mechanistic approach wherein the effects of the DDI on primary PK parameter(s) can be tested. Furthermore, the developed model can be used to identify rational dose adjustments for further prospective evaluation in clinical trials when a DDI is judged to be of clinical importance. The three latter advantages are of course present regardless of the victim drug’s half-life.

Population PK methods are mentioned in the regulatory guidance for DDI studies but only as a last resort option to be used for analysis of PK data (often sparsely sampled) collected trials other than dedicated DDI studies (5,6). The same perspective is presented by the organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of America (PhRMA) (32). This approach can indeed be useful to detect unexpected DDIs or provide evidence in the absence of DDIs. However, population PK has a larger potential than that and we argue for an expanded use of the model-based methods in primary analysis of dedicated DDI studies. It is specifically valuable for drugs with long half-life where NCA analysis may generate biased predictions or demand impractical and expansive study designs, but it also provides additional benefits (making use of metabolite data for improved precision, mechanistic interpretation, dose adjustment simulations) for any victim drug.

CONCLUSION
Utilizing model-based analysis methods to estimate DDIs is crucial for correct characterization when full concentration-time profiles are not captured. The under-predictions of DDI impact by NCA GMRs can be large enough to result in erroneous and potentially dangerous conclusions and decisions regarding the need for dose adjustment. Model-based analysis of interaction effects is always preferable over NCA for drugs with a long half-life and should be the standard methodology.

However, regulatory guidelines and examples of late-stage clinical trial applications in the literature are lacking. This paper communicates Merck’s strategy for the implementation of DBS exemplified by experience on a late-stage program (MK-8931). In this program, DBS was proposed as the sole matrix for phase 3 studies to decrease logistical burden in an aging target patient population (Alzheimer’s disease). In vitro and bioanalytical tests demonstrated initial method feasibility and suitability for further evaluations in the clinic. An in vivo dataset was developed initially in healthy subjects (phase 1 study) and then in patients (phase 2/3 study) to establish a quantitative relationship between the blood and plasma concentrations (bridging dataset) using descriptive and population PK analyses. This allowed for PK conclusions to be seamlessly drawn across the clinical program without impact from the choice of matrix. This integrated information package (in vitro, bioanalytical and clinical) was presented to major regulatory agencies (FDA and EMA) for regulatory input. Based on this package, regulatory concurrence was gained on accepting DBS as the sole matrix in late-stage clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION
Since its original application for the detection of phenylketonuria in neonates half a century ago, dried blood spots (DBS) have gained popularity as a screening tool for various diagnostic tests including metabolic disorders, therapeutic drug monitoring, and HIV infection in neonates (1–3). The pharmaceutical industry and regulators have continued to explore the potential of DBS as a viable alternate matrix for pharmacokinetic analyses (4–6). DBS was initially evaluated at Merck in 2001 for discovery stage PK studies and subsequently implemented for the pediatric development program of an anti-HIV compound in 2009. Since then, a number of compounds have been evaluated for initial in vitro and bioanalytical feasibility to implement DBS. A subset of these has progressed to implementation of DBS in clinical trials, including late-stage clinical trials. Strategically, Merck has chosen to primarily focus the application of DBS towards late-stage patient studies (phase 2 and/or 3) where it has the potential to render greater impact. In our opinion, the value proposition for DBS from a clinical perspective is as follows:To add flexibility in the collection of PK data in phases 2 and 3 studies: Typically, sparse PK samples in phases 2 and 3 studies are constrained to limited time windows during a clinic visit. DBS, particularly in an out-patient setting, expands the window for access to such data. This may be especially beneficial for drugs with long half-lives or long acting formulations to evaluate steady-state or time for washout, or where clinical endpoints are collected by patient-completed diaries or are episodic (e.g., migraine, asthma, or erectile dysfunction trials). However, sampling methods in an out-patient setting need to mature further to gain adequate precision for pharmacokinetic modeling.

Decreased patient burden (blood volume) in vulnerable populations: The smaller sample volumes typically associated with DBS (three spots of ∼20–40 μL each) vs. typical plasma samples (∼200–1000 μL) are clinically attractive for vulnerable populations where blood volumes are a clinical or ethical concern (e.g., younger pediatric or elderly populations). However, DBS should not be considered an automatic choice for studies in such populations. Equal consideration should be given to liquid microsampling approaches.

Improved logistical feasibility: DBS sampling offers a number of logistical advantages (e.g., ambient temperature storage or shipping, no need for specialized equipment such as refrigerated centrifuges and simplified sample preparation) that may reduce operational burden associated with PK sampling in larger multi-center patient trials and lead to potential cost savings. A reduced operational burden may encourage greater participation of clinical sites for PK evaluation in phases 2 or 3 trials, and thereby enrich the database for characterization of the population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationships. Prior to implementing ambient shipping for DBS, the extended stability of DBS samples should be established to ensure integrity of the samples.



DBS has been used extensively for the measurement of endogenous biomarkers of disease (7,8). Merck is exploring the use of DBS for clinical laboratory tests and biomarkers. Continued development of these approaches and coordination with PK measurements is anticipated to further enhance the value proposition for DBS in clinical trials.

Despite the upside potential of DBS, companies and regulators have wrestled with its utility and regulatory expectations compared to traditional matrices. Recently, the European Bioanalysis Forum (EBF) and IQ have published position papers reflecting a range of opinions on DBS (9,10). However, industry regulatory consensus positions and regulatory guidelines for DBS in clinical development programs have been slow to emerge. Further, with few exceptions, the literature has focused on technological challenges and bioanalytical considerations. Rowland and Shepard provide an overview of the requirements for the interpretation of DBS data in development and addressed some of the regulatory considerations that would pave the way to gaining acceptance for DBS (11). A theoretical assessment of pharmacokinetic considerations in the interpretation of DBS data has been published by Emmons and Rowland (12). However, the literature lacks in-depth guidance on pharmacokinetic analyses, modeling, or late-stage clinical considerations, especially when integrating across a clinical program with studies that include both plasma and DBS sampling.

The use of DBS should be thoughtfully weighed on a case-by-case basis with consideration to pros/cons of its use relative to traditional matrices for a given program. Successful implementation hinges on prospective multi-disciplinary (e.g., Bioanalytical, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD), Clinical Pharmacology, regulatory) planning. As most clinical development programs employ plasma sampling for phase 1 studies, a robust in vivo bridging strategy should be developed that allows quantitative inter-conversion of pharmacokinetic information between matrices. This allows pharmacokinetic conclusions to be drawn across studies agnostic to matrix. The overarching PKPD objectives for the program (e.g., evaluation of intrinsic/extrinsic factors, exposure-response) should remain a core consideration and not be impacted by the choice of the bioanalytical matrix.

This paper presents Merck’s strategy for the application of DBS in clinical programs which has been shaped by experience gained from implementation on clinical programs. This augments an earlier company position paper where initial experience, bioanalytical, and logistical considerations were communicated (6). Of note, this summary is intended to inform the scientific community of an emerging area of interest with limited industry or regulatory precedence and is not intended to represent a broader consensus position by regulators or industry. The strategy is composed of staged implementation steps where initial methodological feasibility is established through a series of in vitro and bioanalytical evaluations. DBS is introduced in a staged manner in the clinic whereby DBS samples are taken concurrently with plasma initially in a healthy subject study and then in patients. Descriptive and population PK analyses of these data are conducted in a “learn and confirm” paradigm. Regulatory feedback is sought on this comprehensive data package (Fig. 1). Implementation of this strategy is exemplified through experience gained from MK-8931, a clinical program where regulatory concurrence was gained for the acceptance of DBS as the sole PK collection matrix for late phase trials.Fig. 1 Components of the integrated DBS strategy



CASE STUDY: MK-8931
Strategic Rationale
MK-8931 is currently in late-stage development for Alzheimer’s disease. DBS would allow for shipping at ambient temperature and render a number of other logistical advantages that could encourage clinical site participation and facilitate faster study enrollment for large multi-site clinical trials. Additionally, the reduced blood volume associated with DBS collection was anticipated to reduce patient burden. The goal of implementation was to pursue DBS as the sole matrix for late-stage clinical trials. The characterization of exposure-response relationships was considered an important element for dose justification. Thus, the bridging package needed to be robust to allow clinical studies to be pooled across the clinical program for population PK and exposure-response analyses in anticipation of regulatory submission and labeling.

Initial Feasibility Assessment
Initially, a set of in vitro and bioanalytical assessments were conducted to ascertain methodological feasibility prior to further evaluations in the clinic. These tests were conducted over a clinically relevant concentration range and required good communication between the bioanalytical and PKPD scientists.

In Vitro Tests
As detailed in the publication of Rowland and Emmons (12), plasma protein binding, blood–cell to unbound plasma concentration ratio (ρ), and hematocrit are important in vitro determinants of the blood to plasma ratio and the suitability of DBS as a pharmacokinetic matrix. Emmons and Rowland hypothesize that compounds with a blood to plasma ratio ranging from 0.55 to 2, and non-concentration-dependent unbound fraction (fu) and ρ can be equally analyzed by blood or plasma (5,12).

The average MK-8931 in vitro blood to plasma ratio was 1.22 at 1 μM based on radiolabelled experiments. The blood to plasma ratio was concentration independent in the range of 0.03 to 10 μM (bracketing the clinical concentration range). MK-8931 was modestly plasma protein bound (~65% in human plasma) and not concentration dependent in the range of 0.03 to 1 μm. The in vitro tests showed that DBS or plasma would be equally valid as a matrix for MK-8931 PK assessments.

Bioanalytical Tests
Prior disseminations summarize Merck’s strategy for evaluating bioanalytical feasibility (6,13). These tests encompass assay sensitivity and range, DBS card type and extraction methods, the impact of hematocrit on the bioanalytical method over a wide range, impact of spot volume/homogeneity, stability (including relevant metabolites) at extremes of temperate and relative humidity (potentially encountered during shipping), and any considerations specific to the quantitation of the molecule (e.g., concentration-dependent binding to target and/or plasma). There are currently no established regulatory guidances for bioanalytical method development or validation specific to DBS. Hence, following a decision to pursue DBS, regulatory bioanalytical guidelines, internal SOPs, and industry best practices for plasma assays are applied for bioanalytical validation.

For MK-8931, venous blood was drawn into a single EDTA collection vial and a small quantity spotted onto a DBS card; the remaining blood sample was centrifuged to extract plasma. MK-8931 concentrations were analyzed in both the DBS and the plasma samples. The DBS analytical method was based on either direct extraction or direct extraction followed by liquid–liquid extraction of MK-8931 from human dried blood spots on DMPK-A cards. The analyte from DBS samples and its stable isotope labeled internal standard contained in the extraction solvent were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 1 ng/mL with a 3-mm punch size and was deemed adequate for clinical trials. Hematocrit was shown not to have an analytically relevant effect on MK-8931 concentration measurements in the range of 19.5 to 86.0%. Following the receipt of clinical study samples, incurred sample re-analysis (ISR) was completed to further validate the reproducibility of the assay methodology. Assay validation and clinical performance are summarized in Tables I and II. Bland-Altman plots comparing DBS and plasma concentrations showed a lack of bias between the methods (Fig. 2). The DBS analytical method was considered to have robust performance for use in a clinical setting.Table I Assay Validation Performance Summary for MK-8931

In other instances, bioanalytical evaluations have ruled out DBS as a possible matrix. For example, one compound exhibited high levels of a circulating glucuronide metabolite and stability testing of DBS samples containing the glucuronide showed that it back-converted to parent compound at both room temperature and low temperature with acidification. This would confound the accurate measurement of the parent compound. Therefore, traditional plasma sampling with acidification to stabilize the metabolite was considered a more viable option, and DBS was not further pursued. In other instances, DBS has been successfully evaluated in early clinical studies, but the program failed to advance, and therefore, no further DBS data were collected (13).

In Vivo Bridging
General Considerations
As most clinical development programs are initiated with, and likely to retain phase 1 studies with plasma assays, a quantitative in vivo relationship between blood and plasma concentrations is established through “bridging studies.” These typically encompass a staged evaluation commencing in a healthy subject study and then proceeding to a patient study. In each study, DBS and plasma samples are taken concurrently at various PK sampling time points that span a therapeutically relevant concentration range. Depending on whether the proposed future clinical trial (after bridging is established) would continue blood collection through venipuncture or in an out-patient setting, DBS may be collected via venipuncture in the clinic or through finger sticks. As sample collection has a direct impact on the quality of DBS assessments, Merck has developed extensive training material (including videos and educational materials) for sites for guidance on sample handling, and shipping. The participation of PKPD and/or BA scientists in start-up meetings is encouraged to ensure participating sites are appropriately educated on practical considerations of sample collection and handling.

For the healthy subject evaluation, an existing clinical pharmacology study (e.g., multiple ascending dose, control arm of a DDI, or special population study) should be leveraged. No a priori sample size is recommended; a typically sized clinical pharmacology study (e.g., 12–16 subjects) is sufficient. Subsequently, bridging data should be collected from an early patient study (e.g., phase 1b or POC).

Merck utilizes a “weight of evidence” approach that includes a series of graphical/descriptive evaluations and with equal or greater weightage given to population pharmacokinetic analyses. These analyses should follow a learn and confirm paradigm. Analyses should commence with the healthy subject study in an exploratory or “learning” mode and be confirmed in the patient study. Based on input provided for MK-8931 during the EMA oral hearing, an external qualification of the blood–plasma relationship is highly desirable. Establishing and qualifying this relationship enables pharmacometric analyses of concentration data across studies in a clinical program in support of the submission package and labeling.

Healthy Study
For MK-8931, DBS was initially included along with plasma concentrations in healthy subjects in a clinical pharmacology study (12 subjects contributing 11 samples each). DBS samples were collected via venipuncture in the clinic. A number of graphical and descriptive analyses were conducted. Concurrently drawn DBS and plasma concentrations were plotted to explore data trends (Fig. 3a). The blood to plasma slope (95% CI) estimated by regression was 1.29 (1.27, 1.31), which was in close agreement with the in vitro estimated blood to plasma (B:P) ratio of 1.22. Of note, while regression fits may be applied to quantify the relationship, a prospective R2 cutoff should not be applied as a go/no go criterion. Further, non-linear trends should not be inferred as a lack of utility of DBS. Observed mean (Fig. 3b) and individual (Fig. 3c) concentrations were plotted by nominal time. The plots include MK-8931 concentration data derived from plasma, DBS, and “DBS-predicted plasma concentrations” (DBS concentration divided by the slope from regression fit of 1.29). The measured and DBS converted plasma concentrations were generally comparable and followed similar trends over time. These graphical and descriptive analyses suggested that the in vivo B:P relationship was well characterized in healthy subjects.Fig. 3

Note: DBS-predicted plasma concentrations were calculated as measured DBS divided by 1.29, the slope of the DBS-plasma linear regression line. c Plasma and blood concentration-time data for individual subjects from a phase 1 bridging study of MK-8931.

In Merck’s experience, the aforementioned graphical plots have been well received by regulators. Additionally, a mixed-effects modeling approach could be applied to evaluate the blood and plasma concentration data. In this approach, time-matched DBS and plasma concentration data pairs are fitted to a mixed-effects model (e.g., ln(DBS) = slope * ln (plasma)) in a program such as NONMEM. Inter- and intra-individual variability terms as well as the influence of covariates such as hematocrit may be evaluated using this approach.

Equal or greater weightage was applied to population PK as a critical element of the overall bridging strategy. Implementation followed a learn and confirm paradigm as shown in Fig. 4. MK-8931, DBS, and plasma concentration data from the phase 1 study were used to update an existing plasma population pharmacokinetic model. Blood concentrations were modeled as a separate compartment with an estimated population “slope” that related blood and plasma concentrations (Fig. 5). Separate residual error terms were applied for blood and plasma. Parameter estimates and errors were similar between a model that included plasma data alone and one that included plasma and DBS and were consistent with historical knowledge of the compound (Table III). The population slope (% relative standard error) estimated from the model was 1.27 (4.61%) and similar to that obtained from the regression analyses and the in vitro blood to plasma ratio. The impact of inter-individual variability on slope was explored and found not to be significant. Existing covariate relationships from the plasma model were applied to the plasma-DBS model; however, the impact of covariates on the slope was not evaluated at this stage. Random effects and residual errors for the parameters were within reasonable limits. Other key modeling parameters (e.g., clearance) were also well estimated which would be of relevance to support covariate analyses (a key objective for the phase 2/3 population PK evaluations).Fig. 4 Road map for application of population PK to establish a quantitative bridge between plasma and DBS concentrations

Modeling best practices and diagnostics were applied to explore the goodness of fit and the quantitative interchangeability of exposure metrics derived from the two matrices. Standard diagnostics and goodness of the fit plots such as visual predictive checks or CWRES (conditional weighted residuals) or IWRES (individual weighted residuals) vs. time plots differentiated by matrix were used to rule out the patterns of systematic bias or model mis-specification. Another useful diagnostic was to compare the individual post hoc plasma exposures from the plasma-DBS bridging study using (1) the plasma data from the bridging study and the plasma alone model and (2) the DBS data from the bridging study and the plasma + DBS model, using model-estimated slope to convert to a plasma exposure. DBS-based exposure estimates were similar and did not show any over- or under-prediction bias compared to the plasma-based estimates (Fig. 6).Fig. 6 Individual MK-8931 model-predicted exposures using plasma alone data and model vs. from DBS concentration data converted to plasma using the model-estimated population slope



Of note, while the blood to plasma relationship of MK-8931 was linear, if the underlying relationship for a given compound is non-linear, a more complex parametric description could be developed. However, the increased parameterization would need to be balanced relative to the overall advantages conferred by DBS to the program.

Patient Study
Descriptive and population analyses in healthy subjects supported the continued utility of DBS. Therefore a subsequent bridging dataset was developed in patients to confirm this relationship in a more heterogeneous and relevant patient population. For MK-8931, this was obtained from an early cohort of patients in a late-phase clinical trial. Concurrent DBS and plasma samples by venipuncture in clinic were taken pre-dose and as three sparse PK samples over a 13-week period. Additional DBS and plasma samples continued to be collected from the study based on advice received at an EMA oral hearing to develop an external qualification dataset.

Simulations using the phase 1 pop PK model were used to develop prospective go/no go decision criteria and included in the modeling analysis the plan for the patient study to support the decision of whether DBS could be used as the sole matrix for future phase 3 studies. The modeling analysis plan would evaluate (i) comparability of model-estimated slope to regression estimated (in vivo) and in vitro blood to plasma ratio, (ii) similarity and lack of bias in parameters and post hoc exposures derived from plasma and DBS converted to plasma, and (iii) similar central tendency of plasma predicted vs. DBS converted plasma predicted exposures. For MK-8931, two decision trees were included in the modeling analysis plan (Fig. 7). These decision trees represent program-specific criteria and need to be adjusted on a case-by-case basis. Based on discussions at the EMA oral hearing, the modeling plan was updated to include an external qualification step where the DBS-plasma population PK model (including the population slope term) would also be used to estimate exposures (based on DBS data alone) for an additional set of patients not utilized for the model development.Fig. 7

A similar set of descriptive and graphical analyses as those performed on data from healthy subjects was planned for data from the patients. Furthermore, the population PK model would be updated with patient-derived DBS data and assessed relative to the proposed modeling plan and decision trees. Additional patient data from this data, not included in model development, would be used for external qualification. In its totality, the modeling plan was designed to evaluate whether DBS could achieve the broader PK objectives of the clinical program, such as application for exposure-response modeling, with a similar degree of fidelity as plasma. These pharmacometric assessments (as well as the preceding strategic, in vitro and bioanalytical components) were a critical aspect of the package submitted to regulatory agencies for feedback on whether DBS would be suitable as the sole matrix for late-stage studies. For blinding considerations, results from the patient study are not included in the current dissemination. These will be the subject of a subsequent external communication upon unblinding of the study.

Regulatory Input
As clinical application of DBS is still emerging, regulatory guidance on DBS is yet to be established. Thus, feedback from key regulatory agencies is recommended in a timely manner for each program. The briefing package should present an integrated assessment of in vitro data, bioanalytical feasibility assessments, and in vivo bridging evaluations. The timing of such correspondence is program specific and should enable subsequent finalization of late-stage clinical plans. We recommend that meeting requests specify input from pharmacometric and bioanalytical reviewers. The inclusion of external expert opinions as part of the submitted dossier may be considered. It is Merck’s experience that comprehensive data packages that included the elements mentioned above enabled more productive regulatory interactions.

This approach was used for MK-8931. The focus of the interactions was to gain regulatory concurrence that the submitted package supported the use of DBS (collected in the clinic via venipuncture) as the sole method of PK sampling in ongoing and future MK-8931 late-stage clinical trials. For MK-8931, FDA interactions occurred at an earlier time frame when the DBS-associated pharmacometric package was not as well developed. The submitted package primarily relied on in vitro and BA feasibility assessments and descriptive/graphical analyses of phase 1 clinical data along with plans for the collection of plasma and DBS bridging data in patients, and the agency agreed that our proposal appeared reasonable. During correspondence, the agency recommended the use of the individual concentration time profiles as denoted in Fig. 3c. A comprehensive background document (inclusive of pharmacometric evaluations) was submitted for scientific advice to the CHMP/EMA. The agency requested an oral hearing as they indicated that this was their first regulatory experience of DBS. The key input received were the following:Merck has presented a comprehensive approach consisting of bioanalytical feasibility considerations and in vitro studies followed by an in vivo bridging program in both healthy and patient populations. Overall, this approach was considered robust to support the use of DBS as the sole source of PK data for the remainder of the MK-8931 phase 3 program.

While the broader strategy was endorsed, the agency cautioned that the implementation of DBS requires unique considerations which may not be readily translatable to other development programs.

There was a strong focus on trying to understand the impact of inter-individual variability on the slope and to ensure that the blood to plasma relationship (i.e., slope) could be applied to describe populations not included in the modeling dataset. The agency recommended that external qualification of the slope be demonstrated to show its predictive value in a dataset not used for model development.

Of note, while the agency acknowledged the potential future benefits of home sampling, they refrained from providing commentary as they considered it to be technology in the early stages of development.



As stated before, the dissemination of this regulatory interaction is intended to advance the field by sharing knowledge in an area with relatively little regulatory precedence or guidance and as such is not intended to reflect a broader regulatory position statement.

DISCUSSION
The strategy for using DBS in clinical programs at Merck has been developed over several years and has been a non-linear process. Merck arrived at its current state by looking at DBS holistically in the context of individual development programs, avoiding a one-size-fits-all approach. Early efforts mainly focused on analytical aspects, and it was only after a whole program approach was adopted, which the broader utility of DBS has started to be realized. Merck’s strategy requires a prospective and multi-study approach to build the data sets to enable successful clinical implementation. As such, the alignment of all groups (analytical, pharmacokinetics, clinical, operations) involved is critical to the successful implementation of DBS. The input from regulatory agencies has been critical to the refinement of our strategy. The feedback on both the analytical and pharmacokinetic aspects demonstrated scientific insightfulness and curiosity, while embracing a forward-looking attitude. As with any new approach, Merck anticipates unexpected hurdles during the development and implementation stages. Learning from the large-scale implementation of DBS in these trials is likely to benefit the broader community and will be the subject of future disseminations.

Future Perspective
Merck believes that the strategies described above will help transform DBS from a niche bioanalytical technology to a practical clinical strategy that can be leveraged for population-based PKPD models suitable for regulatory submissions. Presentations of such data packages to regulators should build regulatory confidence in acceptance of DBS as a mainstream matrix and presumably influence future regulatory guidance. Merck believes that investing in novel methodologies such as these is an essential part of the solution to addressing rising drug development costs, while still meeting regulatory agencies expectations to demonstrate a robust understanding of the PKPD relationship of new therapeutic agents and demands by payers to reduce costs.

Often, renal adverse effects are recognized only during clinical stages of drug development. The current study aimed to establish a robust and a more complete human cell model suitable for screening of drug-related interactions and nephrotoxicity. In addition to endogenously expressed renal organic cation transporters and efflux transporters, conditionally immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells (ciPTEC) were completed by transduction of cells with the organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 or OAT3. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting upon exposure to the OAT substrate fluorescein successfully enriched transduced cells. A panel of organic anions was screened for drug-interactions in ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3. The cytotoxic response to the drug-interactions with antivirals was further examined by cell viability assays. Upon subcloning, concentration-dependent fluorescein uptake was found with a higher affinity for ciPTEC-OAT1 (Km = 0.8 ± 0.1 μM) than ciPTEC-OAT3 (Km = 3.7 ± 0.5 μM). Co-exposure to known OAT1 and/or OAT3 substrates (viz. para-aminohippurate, estrone sulfate, probenecid, furosemide, diclofenac, and cimetidine) in cultures spanning 29 passage numbers revealed relevant inhibitory potencies, confirming the robustness of our model for drug-drug interactions studies. Functional OAT1 was directly responsible for cytotoxicity of adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir, while a drug interaction with zidovudine was not associated with decreased cell viability. Our data demonstrate that human-derived ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3 are promising platforms for highly predictive drug screening during early phases of drug development.

INTRODUCTION
The renal proximal tubules play a major role in eliminating waste products from the body, including drugs and their metabolites. Their active secretion and reabsorption mechanisms together with biotransformation capacity make proximal tubule cells especially sensitive to drug-induced toxicity and subsequent acute kidney injury (AKI) (1). Not surprisingly, nephrotoxicity is a significant cause for drug attrition during pharmaceutical development, often recognized only during clinical stages of development as translation from in vitro and animal studies to human lacks high predictivity (2,3).

An in vitro model with high predictive value for drug-induced nephrotoxicity should closely reflect the in vivo processes involved in renal drug handling. More specific, a robust cell-based model should include a proximal tubule epithelium stably expressing a broad range of functional transporters and metabolic enzymes that act in concert in renal drug elimination (4). This process may be affected in concomitant drug treatment, leading to clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (DDI). The renal elimination mechanism of xenobiotics can roughly be divided into two major pathways, viz. the organic anion and the organic cation system. As a first step in elimination of organic anions in humans, active tubular uptake is mediated by the organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1; SLC22A6) and organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3; SLC22A8) present at the, blood-facing, basolateral side (5). These transporters are characterized by their high affinity and capacity and, as a consequence, are major players in the development of drug-induced nephrotoxicity (6). After uptake, secretion of anionic compounds into the tubular lumen is facilitated by apically expressed efflux transporters, such as the multidrug resistance proteins 2 and 4 (MRP2 and -4; ABCC2 and -4) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; ABCG2) (7). In parallel, renal elimination of organic cations in the human proximal tubular epithelium is facilitated by basolateral uptake, predominantly via the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2; SLC22A2), and apical efflux via multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins 1 and 2-K (MATE1 and -2-K; SLC47A1 and -2) (8) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB1) (9).

Renal drug transporters demonstrate a large overlap in substrate specificity, introducing redundancy in uptake mechanisms of proximal tubule cells, and contributing to the relative high sensitivity of the tissue (6,10). This especially counts for organic anions, as this class comprises the majority of drugs that are excreted by the kidneys. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity related to the proximal tubular epithelium by this class of compounds have been described broadly, including for the acyclic nucleotide phosphonates adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir (11,12). These antiretroviral compounds are used for treatment of HIV, hepatitis B, and cytomegalovirus infections and function as nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs) (13). The exact mechanism of antiviral-induced renal toxicity is still under debate (14), but the involvement of OATs in the uptake of many antivirals has been widely acknowledged (15–17). To prevent NtRTI-induced nephrotoxicity, their uptake can be inhibited by co-administration of an OAT1 inhibitor, such as probenecid (18). As with many other diseases, current antiviral therapy in HIV infections is based on polypharmacy. Increased plasma concentrations and systemic toxicity have been observed with didanosine co-administration of tenofovir in anti-HIV triple therapy, possibly by DDI at the site of OAT1 that limited renal excretion (19). Together, polypharmacy can optimize the life-span of infected patients, but this strategy simultaneously increases the risk for DDI and demands for personalized evaluation of the benefit/risk ratio for each drug (20).

The aim of this study was to establish a robust human cell model that allows prediction of drug-induced nephrotoxicity and DDI of organic anions, with a focus on antivirals. We evaluated conditionally immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells (ciPTEC) as a preclinical in vitro prediction model (21). This model already demonstrated to be highly predictive for studying DDI at the site of OCT2 (22) and to endogenously exhibit metabolic enzymes (23) together with a panel of functional efflux transporters (21,24). However, the expression of OAT1 and OAT3 was rapidly lost in culture. Here, these transporters were stably expressed in ciPTEC by transduction, followed by an elegant selection procedure using OAT transporter functionality, completing the relevant renal xenobiotic transporters in ciPTEC. The function of both transporters appeared to be stable upon prolonged culturing. These unique characteristics of the presented OAT containing human cell lines allowed screening for DDI using known pharmacological OAT1 and OAT3 substrates and/or inhibitors. Upon validation, we demonstrated that OAT-mediated uptake in ciPTEC are key determinants in antiviral-induced cytotoxicity. These findings underscore that ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3 are valuable tools for drug-induced toxicity screening.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
Conditionally immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells (ciPTEC) were developed as described by Wilmer et al. with informed consent of the donors in accordance with the approved guidelines of the Radboud Institutional Review Board (21). Cells were seeded 7 days prior to the experiment at their corresponding density (55,000 cells/cm2 for ciPTEC parent cells, 63,000 cells/cm2 for ciPTEC-OAT1, and 82,000 cells/cm2 for ciPTEC-OAT3) and grown for 1 day at 33°C and 5% v/v CO2 to allow proliferation, enabled by the temperature-sensitive mutant of SV large T antigen (SV40T). Next, cells were cultured for 6 days at 37°C and 5% v/v CO2 to stimulate differentiation and formation of an epithelial monolayer, described as “maturation.” Cells were cultured using Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM HAM’s F12, Life Technologies, Paisly, UK), 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml selenium, 35 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 40 pg/ml tri-iodothyronine (Sigma, St. Louis, USA), and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Greiner Bio One, Kremsmuenster, Austria). Medium was refreshed every second day, supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) at 33°C and without pen/strep at the maturation temperature of 37°C. Three T3 mouse-fibroblast (3 T3) cells were cultured at 37°C and used only as irradiated non-proliferating feeder cells for sub-cloning procedures upon transduction, as described (21).

Vector Construction
Vector construction was performed using Gateway Cloning Technology (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Commercially obtained vectors containing OAT1 (pENTR201-hOAT1, Harvard Plasmids HsCD00044153) and OAT3 (pENTR201-hOAT3, HsCD00044090) were transferred into a pLenti4/V5-DEST vector by LR recombinant reaction, resulting in expression vectors pLenti4/V5-EX-hOAT1 and pLenti4/V5-EX-hOAT3. The inducible CMV-TetO2 promoter was replicated from pcDNA5-FRT-TO (Invitrogen) using primers that introduce ClaI (forward Cla1-CMV-TetO2: GCCGCCATCGATGCCGCCGTTGACATTGATTATTGACT) and EcoRI restriction sites (reverse EcoRI-CMV-TetO2: GGCGGCGAATTCGGCGGCCGGAGGCTGGATCGGTCCCGG). The resulting PCR product (ClaI-CMV-TetO2-EcoRI) was purified using the High Pure PCR Product Purification kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Both PCR product and expression vectors were digested by ClaI and EcoRI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA) for 1 h at 37°C and, after purification, ligation was performed with a 1:3 (insert:vector) unit ratio using T4 ligase (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 37°C, resulting in the pLenti expression constructs (pLenti4/V5-EX-CMV-TetO2-hOAT1 and pLenti4/V5-EX-CMV-TetO2-hOAT3).

OAT Transduction in ciPTEC
To obtain lentiviral particles containing the OAT constructs, lentiviral stock was produced by transfecting the pLenti expression constructs with packaging plasmid mix into the HEK293FT cell line using ViraPower Lentiviral Gateway Expression Systems (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. CiPTEC were cultured to 50–70% confluency and exposed to lentiviral particles for 24 h. Both ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3 were selected and subcloned to obtain a homogeneous cell population. To this end, transduced ciPTEC-OAT3 cells were plated into three separate culture flasks (100, 300, and 900 cells) containing irradiated (30 Gy) non-proliferating 3 T3 cells as described by Saleem et al. (25). After 2–3 weeks, single cell colonies of ciPTEC-OAT3 were picked and cultured. Transduction efficiency for ciPTEC-OAT1 was lower than for ciPTEC-OAT3, making immediate subcloning difficult. Therefore, the heterogeneous cell population of ciPTEC-OAT1 was enriched by positive selection of fluorescein-transporting cells. Only successfully transduced ciPTEC express functional OAT; hence, positive selection could be performed upon exposure to the OAT substrate fluorescein using BD FACSAria SORP flow cytometer (BD biosciences, San Jose, USA). Twenty million ciPTEC-OAT1 cells were suspended in HBSS (Invitrogen) containing 1 μM fluorescein and incubated for 10 min at 37°C before fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Enriched ciPTEC-OAT1 cells were subcloned as described for ciPTEC-OAT3. Both ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3 were cultured for up to 30 passages after transduction to study stability of OAT1 and OAT3 expression.

OAT-Mediated Fluorescein Uptake
To evaluate OAT transporter function and inhibition properties of several known OAT substrates, fluorescein uptake was measured by flow cytometry and multi-plate reader. Mature monolayers of sub-cloned ciPTEC spanning 29 passages were co-incubated with fluorescein (1 μM, unless stated otherwise) and a test compound in HBSS for 10 min at 37°C. Compounds known for their inhibitory effect on OAT-mediated transport, para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), estrone sulfate, probenecid, furosemide, cimetidine, diclofenac, adefovir, cidofovir, tenofovir, and zidovudine, were tested. The organic cation metformin was included as a negative control. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma, unless stated otherwise. Uptake was stopped by washing three times with ice-cold HBSS (4°C). For flow cytometry, samples were harvested following fluorescein exposure using trypsin-EDTA, washed, fixed using 0.5% paraformaldehyde, and measured using FACS calibur (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, USA). For 96-well plate assay, cells were lysed by 200 μl 0.1 M NaOH for 10 min at 37°C, and fluorescence was measured (exCitation 485 nm, emission 535 nm) using the multiplate reader Victor X3 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, USA).

Viability Assays
To evaluate toxicity induced by antivirals, viability of ciPTEC was evaluated by an MTT assay (26). Briefly, monolayers of ciPTEC (96-wells) were exposed to antivirals in serum-free medium (SFM) on day 6 of maturation. Cell toxicity was analyzed further in presence of MRP and BCRP efflux inhibitors MK571 (5 μM) and KO143 (10 μM). After incubation for 24, 48, and 72 h at 37°C, ciPTEC were washed and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) for 3 h at 37°C in absence of antivirals. Formazan crystals formed in viable cells were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Merck, Whitehouse Station, USA), and optical density was measured (560 nm, background at 670 nm was subtracted) using Benchmark Plus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA).

Gene Expressions in ciPTEC
Total RNA was isolated from matured ciPTEC (6-well plates) spanning 10 passages for ciPTEC-OAT1 and 11 passages for ciPTEC-OAT3 using TRIzol (Life Technologies Europe BV) and chloroform extraction. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels were evaluated using gene-specific primer-probe sets obtained from Life Technologies: OAT1 (SLC22A6, hs00537914), OAT3 (SLC22A8, hs00188599), GAPDH (hs99999905), and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The quantitative PCR reactions were performed using CFX96-Touch Real-Time PCR System (BioRad) and analyzed using BioRad CFX Manager (version 1.6). mRNA levels for ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3 were calculated using GAPDH as a reference gene and compared to gene expressions in human kidney homogenates in triplicate.

Data Analysis
A Michaelis-Menten equation was combined with linear diffusion to fit fluorescein uptake data after background subtraction with GraphPad Prism (version 5.03). For calculation of IC50 values, log (concentration inhibitor) versus fluorescein uptake was plotted after background subtraction using GraphPad Prism.

For MTT and fluorescein inhibition assays, data were normalized to the viability or activity of untreated control cells. Non-linear regression with variable slope constraining the top to 100% was used to fit the data after background subtraction with GraphPad Prism. Statistics was performed by two-way ANOVA (two-tailed, α = 0.05) using GraphPad Prism as well. All data is presented as mean ± SEM of at least three separate experiments (n = 3) performed in triplicate, unless stated otherwise.

RESULTS
Functional OAT Expression in ciPTEC
The absence of endogenous OAT1 and OAT3 expression in ciPTEC was demonstrated by exposure to fluorescein (1 μM) for 10 min, which did not increase the intracellular fluorescence intensity as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1b, red line). Therefore, OAT transporters were introduced separately by lentiviral transduction. A schematic overview of the experimental approach is provided in Fig. 1a. The transporter genes SLC22A6 and SLC22A8 were cloned under regulation of a CMV promoter and a TetO2 site to conditionally induce the expression. Remarkably, basal expression and function upon transduction of both OAT transporters was positive without tetracycline induction and was not influenced by this inducer (data not shown). Fluorescein uptake capacity (without induction by tetracycline) was used to discriminate between successfully transduced cells and non-transduced cells, reflected by a two sub-populations in the flow cytometer histogram (Fig. 1c). When exposed to 1 μM fluorescein for 10 min, a small cell population accumulated the fluorescent substrate, which was immediately selected using FACS. The fraction of OAT1-positive cells selected (Fig. 1d) accounted for only 8.3% of the total population. The enriched population accumulated fluorescein efficiently, and was sensitive to inhibition by para-aminohippuric acid, a known OAT1 substrates and/or inhibitors (Fig. 1e). The ciPTEC-OAT1 population enriched by FACS and the non-enriched ciPTEC-OAT3 population were subcloned to obtain homogeneous cell populations with high functional OAT transporter expression, demonstrated by qPCR. Expression levels of OAT1 and OAT3 in the respective cell lines were compared to gene expression levels in human kidney tissue homogenates, resulting in a ratio of 0.7 ± 0.2 and 0.14 ± 0.02 for OAT1 and OAT3, respectively. Intact tubular phenotype was demonstrated by functionally active OCT2, for which a drug interaction with cimetidine was shown to be similar to the parent cell line (Fig. S1).Fig. 1 Schematic overview of transduction procedure to obtain ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3. a CiPTEC parent was transduced with OAT1 or OAT3 lentiviral constructs and enriched by FACS using OATs’ capacity to transport fluorescein.

Parent cells exposed to fluorescein did not show increased fluorescence intensity, while ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3 both showed a sub-population with increased fluorescence indicative for OAT functionality, which is sensitive to para-aminohippuric acid-induce inhibition. d Scattered plot showing forward scatter (y axis) and fluorescein intensity (x axis) of transduced ciPTEC-OAT1 exposed to 1 μM fluorescein for 10 min. The population with high-fluorescence intensity indicated by gate P1 (8.3% of total population) was sorted to enrich successfully transduced ciPTEC-OAT1. Transduction with OAT3 was more efficient than OAT1, represented by the larger positive subpopulation in Fig. 1c, making the enrichment protocol redundant for ciPTEC-OAT3. e Histogram of enriched ciPTEC-OAT1 exposed to fluorescein (1 μM, 10 min) in presence (red line) or absence (green line) of competitor para-aminohippuric acid (100 μM) demonstrates increased fluorescence intensity compare to non-enriched ciPTEC, but a heterogeneous population sensitive to para-aminohippuric acid, pointing towards the requirement of subcloning of the enriched cells



Drug-Interaction at the Site of OAT1 and OAT3
Transport kinetics of OAT-mediated fluorescein transport was investigated further by studying the time and concentration dependent uptake of the substrate. Fluorescein uptake demonstrated partial saturation in OAT1- and OAT3-expressing cells (Fig. 2a, b, d) for which a Km and Vmax value was determined taking a passive diffusion component kd into account (Table I). Fluorescein affinity was approximately fivefold higher for OAT1 than for OAT3. Upon fluorescein exposure (10 min, 1 μM), confocal fluorescent imaging confirmed uptake in ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3 (Fig. 2c, e). To demonstrate the uptake was transporter mediated, specific inhibition of fluorescein uptake in presence of two concentrations para-aminohippuric acid (10 and 100 μM) and estrone sulfate (3 and 100 μM) in ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3, was studied (Fig. 2b, d). CiPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3 were evaluated further by determination of IC50 values using concentration-dependent inhibition of fluorescein uptake in presence of para-aminohippuric acid, estrone sulfate, probenecid, furosemide, cimetidine, and diclofenac (Fig. 3, Table II). Overall, IC50 values calculated in our models are in close agreement with previously reported values, although it should be noted that probe substrates may differ and influence IC50 values (Table II). Further confirmation of specificity was obtained using metformin, not affecting OAT-mediated fluorescein uptake in both ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3, as metformin is an OCT substrate (38). The experiments depicted in Fig. 3 were performed in cells spanning 29 passages after transduction. The small variations in these data and maintained fluorescein uptake indicate stable transduction and high robustness of transporter function in ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3.Fig. 2 OAT-mediated fluorescein uptake in ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3. a Concentration-dependent OAT1 and OAT3 mediated uptake of fluorescein after 10 min incubation in ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3.

OATs Mediate Antiviral-Induced Toxicity
As toxicity of antivirals was reported to be associated with OAT1- and OAT3-mediated renal tubular uptake, we investigated their effects on OAT function and cell viability upon drug exposures. Concentration-dependent inhibition of fluorescein uptake via OAT1 was observed by adefovir, cidofovir, tenofovir, and zidovudine, while OAT3 was only associated with zidovudine-fluorescein interactions (Fig. 4, Table III). Next, the DDI indices were determined. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft a DDI guideline (48) recommending to perform clinical DDI studies when the ratio between unbound plasma concentration and IC50 (Cmax,u /IC50) is higher than 0.1. For adefovir, cidofovir, and zidovudine, the IC50 value was less than 10 times the maximal free plasma concentration (Cmax,u/IC50 > 0.1), and, therefore, at clinically relevant plasma concentrations inhibition of OAT1 is likely, and DDI with OAT1 transporter substrates were defined as clinically relevant in our study. Next, cytotoxicity caused by all four antivirals was evaluated after exposure of ciPTEC for 24–72 h to the drugs. As a measure of cytotoxicity, cell viability was analyzed by cellular dehydrogenase capacity, metabolizing MTT into purple formazan. In the parent ciPTEC, viability was not affected by any of the antivirals (48 h, 1 mM), while adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir significantly affected cell viability in ciPTEC-OAT1, and only tenofovir slightly decreased ciPTEC-OAT3 viability (Fig. 5a). Antiviral-induced toxicity was evaluated in more detail, demonstrating a concentration- and time-dependent decrease in viability by adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir in ciPTEC-OAT1, while the effect was less pronounced in ciPTEC-OAT3 (Fig. 5b and Table IV). These findings indicate the direct involvement of the OAT transporters in antiviral-mediated nephrotoxicity, although IC50 values found in the current study are higher compared to those obtained in previous studies (Table IV). The cytotoxic effect of the antivirals correlated nicely with the inhibitory effect on fluorescein uptake, except for zidovudine. Despite a clear inhibition of fluorescein uptake by zidovudine, suggesting OAT-mediated uptake, this compound did not affect cell viability as determined by the MTT assay. To investigate a potential protective effect via intact efflux transporters in ciPTEC, cells were exposed to zidovudine at 10× Cmax (50 μM) in presence of MRP4 and BCRP inhibitors MK571 and KO143, respectively. This did not affect cell viability in ciPTEC, ciPTEC-OAT1, nor ciPTEC-OAT3, indicating that efflux transporters did not counteract intracellular exposure of zidovudine and thereby reducing the cytotoxic potential of zidovudine.Fig. 4 Inhibition of OAT-mediated fluorescein uptake by adefovir, cidofovir, tenofovir, and zidovudine.

DISCUSSION
To improve prediction of the nephrotoxic potential of novel chemical entities and to mechanistically understand the pathways associated with drug-induced toxicity, highly predictive and validated translational models are required. In the present report, we describe such a robust human-based cell model with intact proximal tubular characteristics. Stable OAT1 and OAT3 expression in the human renal cell line ciPTEC allowed studying reproducible DDI for a panel of model substrates and antiviral compounds. Functional OAT1 and OAT3 transport activity was demonstrated to be associated with drug-induced toxicity of the antivirals adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir. These findings indicate that our model predicts drug-induced nephrotoxicity and underscore that functional expression of influx transporters is pivotal in prediction of drug-induced renal toxicity.

Many reports related to studying drug-OAT interactions describe the use of non-polarized overexpression systems, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the human cervical epitheloid carcinoma cell line HeLa, or human epithelial kidney (HEK) 293 cells, which are highly relevant for studying interactions at the single-transporter level but might have a poor overall predictivity due to their simplicity (27,39). Since proximal tubule cells are the main site of adverse drug effects in the kidney, this cell type is preferred for in vitro assays investigating drug-induced nephrotoxicity (1). Human primary proximal tubule cells reflect in vivo toxicological responses best, but lack reproducibility and robustness due to high donor-to-donor variability and limited availability. Moreover, primary cells lose their proximal tubular phenotype upon culturing, and OAT1-4, P-glycoprotein, and MRP expressions were found to be rapidly decreased (50,51). To extend the life span of human proximal tubular cells and to provide a robust model for drug screening, we and others have immortalized primary kidney cells, yet without demonstrating functional OATs (21,52), despite retained gene expressions (53).

The current study demonstrates the first human model with stable expression of OAT1 and OAT3 for up to 10 and 11 passages, respectively, as analyzed by qPCR and functionality of OAT1 and OAT3 for up to 29 passages as analyzed by fluorescein uptake. Experimental values obtained for DDI of model compounds correlated well with published data, confirming PAH has a higher inhibitory potency for OAT1 compared to OAT3, whereas the inhibitory potencies of estrone sulfate, probenecid, and furosemide were clearly higher for OAT3. The IC50 value of cimetidine in ciPTEC-OAT1 is, however, more than fivefold higher as described earlier, whereas ciPTEC-OAT3 inhibition by cimetidine was found well within predetermined ranges (34). This discrepancy may be explained by different substrates used in the studies, where the OAT1-substrate PAH used in earlier studies, has a lower affinity for OAT1 as compared to fluorescein used in the current study. Since tetracyclin-inducible expression of OAT1 and OAT3 in ciPTEC was not achieved, we hypothesize that random integration of the vector could have caused silencing of this particular promoter element. The effects of prototypic inhibitor compounds on drug transport are promising with respect to the application of ciPTEC as a tool to study drug-induced nephrotoxicity, and the proof-of-concept was evaluated further with a selected a panel of clinically relevant antivirals with various pharmacokinetic parameters.

DDIs are a major concern in anti-HIV therapy that includes co-administration of multiple antivirals. We evaluated adefovir, cidofovir, tenofovir, and zidovudine DDI at the site of OAT1 and OAT3. The affinities of adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir were higher for OAT1 than for OAT3, in agreement with previous studies in CHO cells overexpressing hOAT1 and hOAT3 (44). The DDI index has been used to determine the potential of clinical DDI and drug-induced toxicities (48,54) and allows extrapolating in vitro observations to the clinical setting (48,54). In our study, IC50 values of less than 10 times the maximal free plasma concentration (Cmax,u/IC50 > 0.1) were found for adefovir, cidofovir, and zidovudine, indicating these antivirals are likely to inhibit OAT1 and OAT3 at clinically relevant concentrations.

Antiviral-induced nephrotoxicity was shown to be associated with OAT-mediated uptake and further evaluated in the current study (11,15,44,49). We demonstrated that OAT1 or OAT3 expression is required for induction of toxicity by adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir in ciPTEC. The relation between OAT1 transporter affinity and toxicity was described earlier using HeLa cells, transiently expressing hOAT1, in which cidofovir showed a higher affinity as well as a higher toxicity compared to tenofovir (39). In agreement, when the cytotoxic potential of NtRTIs in ciPTEC-OAT1 at 72 h of exposure was ranked, we found that cidofovir has the highest potency over tenofovir and adefovir (44,49). On the other hand, the low potency of adefovir in our study contrasts to the cytotoxicity reported for other cell models (34,54). In general, the toxic potency of the antivirals in ciPTEC is lower as compared to hOAT1-CHO and HEK-OAT1, which may be due to the presence of functional metabolic enzymes and an intact efflux machinery in ciPTEC (44,49,55). RNA expression of phase I enzymes CYP3A4, CYP4A11, and several UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in ciPTEC were found to be comparable to their expression levels in primary PTEC (23,51). Protein expression of the efflux transporters Pgp and MRP4 was demonstrated, as well as functional efflux transport activity of Pgp, MRP4, and BCRP (21,24). From these findings, we conclude that ciPTEC closely reflects the physiological situation, suggesting that our model is of higher predictive value than single overexpression systems. Since MRP4 mediates the efflux of tenofovir, its functional presence in ciPTEC might explain the reduced cytotoxicity in our model as compared to overexpression systems lacking this transporter (15,55). Future research should clarify this.

Activity of phase I and phase II metabolizing enzymes was demonstrated in ciPTEC of which the UGT2B7 subfamily might have been the cause of the tolerance for zidovudine observed in the present study (23). While adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir are largely excreted unchanged by the kidneys, only 23% of zidovudine is eliminated via the urine without metabolic alterations (56). Zidovudine undergoes either phase II metabolism into the non-toxic 5’-zidovudine-O-glucuronide or the antiviral is phosphorylated resulting in mitochondrial toxicity (12,57). As both glucuronidation and phosphorylation take place at the same functional group of zidovudine (5’-OH), the low toxicity of zidovudine suggests a favor for glucuronidation in ciPTEC. Although glucuronidation predominantly takes place in the liver, UGT2B7 expression in ciPTEC might contribute to zidovudine detoxification. Moreover, the toxic side effects of nucleoside analogs have been correlated with the kinetics of incorporation by the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, ranking zidovudine less toxic than tenofovir (58). As efflux inhibition of MRP4 and BCRP did not further reduce viability of ciPTEC upon exposure with zidovudine, the toxicity of this compound is likely not influenced by these efflux transporters. Differences in expression of metabolic enzymes and transporter activities between various cell lines used for toxicity studies should be taken into account when comparing functional readout parameters. Moreover, the broad presence of metabolic enzymes and transporters in our model as well as in freshly isolated PTECs increases their predictive potential, but complicates comparison with more simple models. Taken together, the combined expression of efflux transporters (MRP4, BCRP, MATE2-K, and Pgp) with influx transporters (OAT1/3, OCT2, and SLCO4C1) and metabolic enzymes make ciPTEC suitable to study multiple steps involved in renal elimination and drug-induced nephrotoxicity.

The clinical relevance and impact on drug safety of OAT transporters are well acknowledged by regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry (59). Both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have issued guidance documents, outlining that OAT interactions should be studied for new compounds (48,60). Furthermore, the International Transporter Consortium (ITC) provided decision trees to determine whether a drug candidate may be a substrate (victim) or an inhibitor (perpetrator) of transporters involved in clinically relevant DDI (61). Consequently, pharmaceutical industry started a quest for reliable and high-throughput in vitro models that mimic the human kidney with improved prediction of drug-induced nephrotoxicity and a decrease in use of animals in research (62). Current preclinical tests for prediction of nephrotoxicity are mainly based on animal (rodent) models. These models provide information about systemic toxicity in living organisms, but they bear high costs, are time intensive, and remain an ethical issue. Their clinical predictive value is limited due to inherent interspecies differences in drug disposition and emphasizes the urgent need for human-based models that closely resemble the human kidney physiology (6,63). Current innovations in in vitro models allowing cells to grow in polarized structures under flow conditions, in combination with high-throughput automated systems for toxicity read-outs, will become major steps forward in drug safety screening, for which the ciPTEC model may provide a suitable cellular basis (64). In general, application of ciPTEC as a predictive tool for drug-induced toxicity requires comparison with freshly isolated PTECs and further validation by extrapolation of in vitro data to clinical outcomes.

CONCLUSION
We present the first human PTEC model with stable expression and functionality of OAT1 and OAT3, allowing screening for drug-induced nephrotoxicity and DDI. The NtRTI drugs tenofovir, adefovir, and cidofovir-induced nephrotoxicity and exhibited DDI indices at clinically relevant concentrations. These findings underscore that ciPTEC-OAT1 and ciPTEC-OAT3 are valuable tools for drug-induced toxicity screening that, upon systematic validation, could improve translation of in vitro findings to clinical research and might decrease the use of animal studies in the preclinical stages of drug development.

To facilitate the regulatory application, the FDA implemented a novel data submission program, Voluntary Genomics Data Submission (VGDS), and also to engage the stakeholders. As part of the endeavor, for the past 10 years, the FDA has led an international consortium of regulatory agencies, academia, pharmaceutical companies, and genomics platform providers, which was named MicroArray Quality Control Consortium (MAQC), to address issues such as reproducibility, precision, specificity/sensitivity, and data interpretation. Three projects have been completed so far assessing these genomics technologies: gene expression microarrays, whole genome genotyping arrays, and whole transcriptome sequencing (i.e., RNA-seq). The resultant studies provide the basic parameters for fit-for-purpose application of these new data streams in regulatory environments, and the solutions have been made available to the public through peer-reviewed publications. The latest MAQC project is also called the SEquencing Quality Control (SEQC) project focused on next-generation sequencing. Using reference samples with built-in controls, SEQC studies have demonstrated that relative gene expression can be measured accurately and reliably across laboratories and RNA-seq platforms. Besides prediction performance comparable to microarrays in clinical settings and safety assessments, RNA-seq is shown to have better sensitivity for low expression and reveal novel transcriptomic features. Future effort of MAQC will be focused on quality control of whole genome sequencing and targeted sequencing.

INTRODUCTION
A decade ago, microarrays were the mainstream genomics technology used by the biomedical and pharmaceutical research communities. Using this technique, a large expanse of microarray data has been generated to support the drug development process. For example, genomics data has been used to evaluate drug safety and efficacy in support of both investigational new drug applications (IND) and new drug applications (NDA). To facilitate the submission of genomics data, the FDA created a novel data submission program known as Voluntary Genomics Data Submission (VGDS) and later extended it to Voluntary eXploratory Data Submission (VXDS) so that other omics data could be included. The idea behind this novel submission program was to facilitate FDA’s communication with the sponsor and to identify the best ways to apply omics data in regulatory application. The results of these efforts have helped to develop the Guidance for Industry on Pharmacogenomics (PGx) Data Submission (1). The VXDS program encourages the sponsor to interact with the FDA through submission of PGx data on a voluntary basis. In addition to that, it provides a forum for scientific discussions with the FDA outside of the regulatory review process. This whole process has helped to establish a regulatory environment within the FDA for receiving, analyzing, and interpreting the PGx data.

In order to achieve the goals of the VXDS process, the FDA created a data repository to keep track of all the data submitted by the sponsors (2). The submitted information was important to shape future regulatory policies regarding PGx data submission and review. In an effort to create new standards for receiving PGx data, the FDA sought to reproduce the analysis results and conclusions provided by the sponsor. In addition to that, alternative analysis and biological interpretation were also conducted and compared with the sponsor’s analysis. These efforts established FDA’s view for analysis and interpretation of PGx information.

During these efforts, it was identified that even the slightest change in the statistical methods could lead to substantial differences between the results from the sponsor and those from the agency (1, 2). Differences in the statistical analysis results led to discrepancies in biological interpretation. The high variations in analysis results were not just related to the microarray technology, but were also observed in most of the high-throughput screening technologies, including those utilized in proteomics and metabolomics.

Whenever a new technology is introduced to assist in the process of drug development, the biomedical and pharmaceutical research community tries to evaluate its potentials in understanding the underlying mechanisms of drug efficacy and toxicity. These evaluation efforts enhance the understanding of the utility of the technologies, and the research community learns their appropriate fit-for-purpose applications. However, it may take 15–20 years for an innovative technology to be translated to fit-for-purpose applications in a regulatory setting (3). It is thus of FDA’s interest to be involved in the evaluation efforts in order to expedite such translation. Through the efforts reviewed here, the FDA has demonstrated its commitment to expedite the process of incorporating the application of innovative technologies. These efforts were carried out in collaboration with the research community and stakeholders, with an emphasis on promoting the optimization, reproducibility, and standardization of the analysis protocol, data interpretation, and data sharing.

MAQC CONSORTIUM
The MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) consortium is a community-wide effort led by the FDA to address the above mentioned reproducibility concerns about the genomics technologies. It was started about 10 years ago, involving most FDA centers along with the international research community and industry. Its objective was to analyze the technical performance and utility of emerging molecular technologies (e.g., microarrays, next-generation sequencing) for clinical application and safety assessment. Throughout MAQC efforts, there was a consistent emphasis on transparency. The results and conclusions were published in peer-reviewed journals. The data generated during these efforts has been made freely available to the public. Additionally, some biological samples from which the data were generated are also available from commercial vendors. The consortium started in 2005 and by the end of 2014, three projects were completed. During the course of these projects, three different genomics technologies were evaluated. Under the project MAQC 1 and 2, microarrays were evaluated. Various issues related to the genome-wide genotyping arrays were evaluated in the MAQC 2 project (4–15). The third MAQC project, also known as SEquencing Quality Control (SEQC), evaluated the RNA-seq technology. All three projects evaluated the fit-for-purpose application for clinical and regulatory aspects of those genomics technologies. The entire project published a total of 28 peer-reviewed articles (http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/BioinformaticsTools/MicroarrayQualityControlProject/), and 11 of them were published in Nature Biotechnology (4, 16-24). The paper published from MAQC 1 project supported the FDA in the development of “Guidance for Industry: Pharmacogenomics Data Submission – Companion Guidance.”

The MAQC 1 project demonstrated inter- and intraplatform reproducibility of gene expression measurements by microarrays. The comprehensive study design was centered on cross-site cross-platform performance evaluation through the titration of two reference RNA samples. DNA microarray results were compared with the quantitative PCR platforms for gene expression, and high correlation was observed between them. Additionally, external RNA controls for the assessment of microarray performance were also evaluated, along with various microarray data normalization techniques. Importantly, MAQC 1 studies demonstrated that the combination of fold-change ranking and a non-stringent P value cutoff led to increased consistency in differential gene expression analysis and downstream biological interpretation. The reference RNA samples chosen by the consortium have since become standard material widely adopted by the research community and the biotechnology industry for laboratory proficiency testing and development of new genomics technologies. As a natural progression, the MAQC 2 project studied the development and reliability of microarray-based predictive models for a variety of preclinical and clinical endpoints. Over 30,000 models were developed by 36 data analysis teams using numerous model building methods. Performance evaluation through a strictly blind external validation process demonstrated the utility of well-implemented internal cross validation in gauging the model prediction performance. This carefully designed and executed consortium effort with six large clinical and preclinical microarray datasets demonstrated that reliable predictive models can be developed when including sound and unbiased cross-validation techniques in the process. We expect the conclusions from the MAQC 2 project to be applicable to models based on gene expression data from other high-throughput technologies besides microarrays.

CHALLENGES FOR NGS
The next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies were first introduced to the market in 2005 and have since seen tremendous growth in both technology advancements and research adoption. NGS has a wide spectrum of application in biomedical research including but is not limited to genome and exome sequencing, whole transcriptome sequencing (i.e., RNA-seq), microRNA sequencing, and metagenomics. Some common challenges related to NGS include data storage, transfer, sharing, analysis, and visualization due to the sheer size of NGS datasets, which are referred to as big data challenges. As a tool, the specific application of NGS mainly defines the challenges and issues associated with this technique. Our literature survey on the use of NGS as a tool found that about 50% of the applications are mainly related to the use of NGS to understand genetic variations and their effect on disease and drug response. About a quarter of the applications are related to RNA-seq while the rest of them are split into various areas including microRNA sequencing and metagenomics. Challenges and issues associated with human genome sequencing differs greatly from these associated with microRNA sequencing because the size of the molecular object under investigation varies greatly, i.e., the human genome has 3.2 billion base pairs in contrast to the microRNA size of only 18–25 nucleotides.

THIRD PHASE OF MAQC PROJECT
Due to rapid advances in NGS technologies, the third phase of the MAQC Project was initiated while the second phase was still under the way. As mentioned above, this phase is also known as the SEQC project with its focus on RNA-seq. Over 180 participants from 73 different organizations across 12 different countries participated in the SEQC project. The project generated over 10 TB of data with over 100 billion reads. On submission of this dataset to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository in June 2014, it represented around 6% of the total RNA-seq data in the repository at that time. This rich data provides ample opportunities for RNA-seq data analysis method development. Under this project, four different datasets were generated. The first dataset was generated from six reference samples. These reference samples were sequenced by various laboratories using different RNA-seq platforms such as Illumina HiSeq, Life Technologies SOLiD, and Roche 454. The second dataset was composed of sequencing data for about 500 neuroblastoma samples from pediatric patients. The third dataset was from 100 rat liver samples. The last dataset was a survey of rat transcriptomes using 11 different organs across 4 different developmental stages for both male and female rat. The SEQC project evaluated technical performance, quality control, and cross lab and cross platform reproducibility of RNA-seq. RNA-seq data was also compared with data generated from the same samples by mature microarray technologies. In addition to that, evaluations were made on the use of RNA-seq for clinical applications and safety assessments. The observations from these efforts were published in 10 manuscripts (3, 22-30). Here we present five major findings:
Relative measurement is more consistent than absolute measurement.

We generated large datasets for six reference samples. The samples were sequenced in 11 different laboratories using various platforms (i.e., HiSeq, SOLiD, and 454) (27) with multiple library preparation replicates for each sample at each laboratory. This study design offered us an opportunity to evaluate cross lab and cross platform consistency using the same sample. It allowed us to study both intra-laboratory and cross laboratory variability. Ideally, no gene would be differentially expressed for the same sample when it is sequenced with the same platform in different labs. We observed that as many as 10,000 genes could pass the statistical test to be considered as differentially expressed. In contrary, when differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from any pair of samples were compared across laboratories and platforms, the results were quite consistent (22). Thus, the analyses demonstrated that relative measurement is much more consistent and reproducible than the absolute measurement.

RNA-seq vs microarrays.

Among its broad application, RNA-seq has two major applications, first is to determine DEGs by comparing different conditions, e.g., treatment or disease status. The second use is to develop gene expression-based predictive models. However, microarrays have been used for a long time to perform similar tasks. Bioinformatics methods for analyzing and interpreting the results from microarray data have been assessed and established through the first two MAQC projects. In comparison, RNA-seq is a relatively new technology and analysis methods are continuously being developed. Thus, there is a great interest in the community to compare microarrays and RNA-seq to identify the benefits of using RNA-seq over microarrays. To address the comparison, the SEQC project implemented several studies to comprehensively assess the difference and similarity between these two technologies. In one of them, rat livers treated with 15 chemicals and matched controls were profiled with both technologies and the DEGs detected for each chemical were compared between the two technologies. Of note, these chemicals yielded a wide range of treatment effect with a 10-fold difference between the smallest and largest number of DEGs detected. With this design, we could evaluate the concordance in DEG analysis between RNA-seq and microarrays in various levels of treatment effect. We found that the concordance in DEGs between microarray and RNA-seq was positively correlated with the strength of treatment effect. Further analyses indicated that the discordance was mostly due to the difference between two platforms in quantifying the lowly expressed genes. Specifically, for highly expressed genes, we were able to achieve a concordance of about 75% while the concordance was only 35% for lowly expressed genes. Thus, the major difference between microarrays and RNA-seq lies in their accuracy of measuring lowly expressed genes. Further comparison with quantitative PCR indicated that RNA-seq would likely perform better than microarrays for lowly expressed genes (24).

RNA-seq and Gene Discovery.

An important potential of RNA-seq is its ability to discover novel, unannotated exon-exon junctions, which is affected by read depth. On increasing the number of reads from 10 million to 10 billion, both known genes and novel junctions were continually detected. Importantly, using quantitative PCR to validate some selected novel junctions, we determined that over 80% of them can be verified but their biological functions are unknown (14). This observation opens the door for the research community to peruse the area of increased read depth analysis and identify new transcripts and evaluate the contribution of such new transcripts or genes to understand the underlying biological mechanisms related to disease and toxicity.

Pipeline for RNA-seq.

One of the most asked questions in the research community is which pipeline(s) is to be used for RNA-seq data analysis. To address the question in the context of big data, we evaluated 12 different pipelines in this project. For each pipeline, there are different parameter settings that lead to 278 major permutations covering the common gene modes, various quantification, and normalization methods. The comprehensive assessment was extremely costly in terms of computational time. We identified DEGs and compared the results with quantitative PCR and also evaluated the performance of downstream prediction models. We developed a composite metric including accuracy, precision, sensitivity in detecting lowly expressed genes, specificity in detecting DEGs, and prediction performance to derive the best practice for choosing RNA-seq data analysis pipelines. We observed that the pipeline giving the better estimation of the gene expression likely also gave better performance in predictive modeling. Multiple pipeline components jointly and significantly impacted the quantification of gene expression and downstream prediction performance. The manuscript is currently under review at Nature Methods.

Legacy microarray data in the RNA-seq era.

Microarrays have been widely used in biomedical research and drug development since 1995. Major pharmaceutical companies usually generate thousands of microarrays per year. In this analysis, we tried to address whether RNA-seq-based gene signatures can be applied to microarray data to leverage the investment previously made. We tested three different classifier methods with three gene mapping categories to identify the transferability of microarray information to the RNA-seq data and vice versa. RNA-seq and microarrays were comparable for predictive models. Importantly, signature genes were reciprocally transferable between these two technology platforms. Microarray models can accurately predict RNA-seq-profiled samples. However, RNA-seq was less accurate in predicting microarray-profiled samples, and the performance was affected by modeling algorithms and the gene mapping complexity (26).



PERSPECTIVES AND FUTURE DIRECTION
NGS technologies have emerged as an important tool for many regulatory activities. Various FDA centers have encountered NGS data in regulatory science research and/or regulatory applications. These include but are not limited to (i) FDA oversight of NGS-based assays for diagnosis and prognosis, (ii) applying NGS in food pathogen identification and outbreak detection, (iii) reviewing NGS data for drug efficacy and safety for both clinical and preclinical assessments, and (iv) NGS as an improved tool for studying immunogenicity of vaccines. More specifically for biological products, NGS data can be utilized in various ways to support their development with one current major use being the identification of microbial contaminations (31).

Building upon the success of the previous MAQC projects, which were fundamental for the development of FDA companion guidance to industry on pharmacogenomics data submission, we are in the process of developing a follow-up project, named SEquencing Quality Control Phase 2 (SEQC2). SEQC2 aims to develop quality control metrics and benchmark bioinformatics approaches for the analysis of the whole genome sequencing and targeted gene sequencing data to achieve best practices, to develop standard analysis protocols, and to apply these newer methods in regulatory settings. The ultimate goal of SEQC2 is the development of standards for using NGS data that will provide the FDA with objective criteria and metrics for data quality assessment that can be applied in regulatory settings and to provide information for precision medicine.

In summary, the primary aim of these FDA-led efforts for emerging genomics technologies is to engage the stakeholders and research community for consensus building with respect to the reliable use of genomics data with objective criteria and assessment metrics for data quality and reliability, which can be employed in the FDA for their fit-for-purpose application.

One of the most promising new technologies is the single-use system, which has improved the efficiency of biologics manufacturing processes. To ensure safety of biologics when employing such single-use systems in the manufacturing process, various issues need to be considered including possible extractables/leachables and particles arising from the components used in single-use systems. Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturers, together with single-use suppliers, members of the academia and regulatory authorities have discussed the risks of using single-use systems and established control strategies for the quality assurance of biologics. In this study, we describe approaches for quality risk management when employing single-use systems in the manufacturing of biologics. We consider the potential impact of impurities related to single-use components on drug safety and the potential impact of the single-use system on other critical quality attributes as well as the stable supply of biologics. We also suggest a risk-mitigating strategy combining multiple control methods which includes the selection of appropriate single-use components, their inspections upon receipt and before releasing for use and qualification of single-use systems. Communication between suppliers of single-use systems and the users, as well as change controls in the facilities both of suppliers and users, are also important in risk-mitigating strategies. Implementing these control strategies can mitigate the risks attributed to the use of single-use systems. This study will be useful in promoting the development of biologics as well as in ensuring their safety, quality and stable supply.

INTRODUCTION
A single-use system is a system comprised of single-use components, as the main apparatus/equipment. In recent years, the use of single-use systems, such as single-use culture bags in place of the conventional stainless steel culture tanks, has been increasing in the manufacture of biologics (i.e. recombinant therapeutic proteins). Utilization of novel single-use technologies has promising advantages that include increased efficiency of manufacturing, including prevention of cross contamination in the manufacture of high-potency compounds, flexibility to manufacture multiple products and elimination of the need for cleaning and steam sterilization including those validations. However, this approach has also raised new issues and concerns related to process control and product quality assurance.

Based on accumulated scientific knowledge and quality risk management concepts, this study identifies points that need to be considered with respect to quality assurance for biologics manufactured with single-use systems. The issues described to ensure the quality of biologics manufactured using single-use systems reflect generally accepted concepts, but the individual risks and the development of a risk-mitigating strategy should not be limited to these. In each individual case, aspects raised in this study may be applied selectively, but it is of paramount importance that the risks are appropriately assessed according to technological advances and the quality profile of the intended product and that appropriate risk control is implemented correctly.

SCOPE
This study applies to single-use components, including bags, filters, tubing, and connectors used in processes for manufacturing biologic drug substance and drug products, as well as systems comprised of single-use components. Drug product containers (primary packaging), however, are outside the scope of this study, since in these cases, the appropriate requirements are stipulated by the pharmacopoeia (e.g. Japanese Pharmacopoeia).

BASIC REQUIREMENTS
The quality assurance of biologics encompasses an evaluation of the raw materials as well as manufacturing process controls for the drug substance and drug product. All procedures must comply with ministerial regulation of good manufacturing practice and the pharmacopoeia (e.g. Japanese Pharmacopoeia) [1–15], in addition to other regional requirements [16–20], such as the Standard for Biological Ingredients in Japan. ICH Q9 and other relevant guidelines [21–32] are useful references for the general rules and procedures recommended for quality risk management. Identification of the risks that affect quality, efficacy, safety and stable supply of biologics and the establishment of control strategies are basic requirements for the development of a manufacturing process of biologics using single-use systems. These risk management processes should be shared between the relevant parties.

There are important elements in quality systems that are intended to improve the quality and stable supply of biologics. Establishing quality control strategies on the basis of appropriate risk assessments is beneficial to ongoing improvement throughout the biologics lifecycle, as well as communication between single-use component suppliers, end users and regulatory authorities.

RISK ASSESSMENT
Risk factors associated with the use of single-use systems may be related to product quality or to the stable supply of biologics. Risks should be identified, and the magnitude of the risk should be estimated using standard risk management practices, which evaluate attributes such as impact and uncertainty, or severity and likelihood. An identified risk should be analysed and compared to risk criteria to decide whether it is acceptable or should be mitigated. The tools that may be used for risk assessment include qualitative techniques such as a risk matrix and semi-quantitative techniques such as risk scores. ICH Q9 is a useful reference for a detailed description of risk assessment.

Impact on the Quality of Biologics
Residual Impurities
One of the quality-related issues resulting from the use of single-use components is the risks of residual impurities including leachables, insoluble particulate matter and insoluble visible matter (hereinafter termed single-use component-related impurities). These impurities could be the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of drug substance/drug product by themselves. In order to avoid potential health hazards, a list of all the impurities that might be introduced into the manufacturing process should be prepared and subjected to risk assessment to identify risks that should be controlled. Information provided by suppliers about the raw materials, manufacturing process, test results and prior experience may be used in addition to the results of tests conducted by end users.

Extractables and Leachables
Chemicals derived from single-use components that are introduced into the process solution under conditions of exaggerate temperature, pH or solvent are called extractables, whereas chemicals that migrate under actual process conditions are termed leachables [33–36]. Extractables/leachables may include a variety of chemicals or their derivatives used in the manufacture of single-use components such as catalysts, polymeric initiators, excipients (e.g. antioxidants, lubricants, anti-tack and anti-static agents), oligomers with a low degree of polymerization, adhesives, anchoring agents, adhesive resins and irradiation-induced degradation products and oxides.The chemical profiles of leachables should be identified to the extent possible and feasible on the basis of test results for extractables provided by the supplier, and as necessary by conducting tests on the actual manufacturing process solutions or on simulations, under conditions designed to mimic worst case scenarios. If test results for extractables provided by the supplier are to be used when evaluating leachables, a determination should be made as to whether the extractables preparation procedures and analytical methods are appropriate. Sterilization of single-use components by radiation can also result in additional extractables/leachables; hence, the sterilization conditions have an important role when using test results for extractables provided by the supplier and should be clearly specified. The necessity to test for leachables in either the process solution or a simulation arises when they are difficult to predict from the test results for extractables, or when it is considered possible that a new moiety, may be eluted during the manufacturing process.Risk assessments for all possible leachables should be conducted, and permitted ranges should be defined for chemicals that are considered to require control. Toxicity evaluations should be conducted when analysing and evaluating risk.

Insoluble Particulate Matter
In this study, insoluble particulate matter is defined as any invisible insoluble impurity derived from a single-use component and is distinguished from insoluble visible matter. Insoluble particulate matter may derive from an airborne solid in a single-use component manufacturing facility or raw materials or components used in the process of manufacturing the single-use components. There may be various insoluble particulate matters of different composition and particle size.As discussed for the leachables, tests for insoluble particulate matter, generally using water, should be conducted with reference to the information provided by the supplier (e.g. raw material, manufacturing processes, manufacturing environment, procedures to control insoluble particulate matter). Existence and characteristics of insoluble particulate matter derived from single-use components should be identified, to the extent possible and feasible. The Japanese Pharmacopoeia ([4] <6.07> “Insoluble particulate matter for injections”), as well as the European Pharmacopoeia ([13] <2.9.19> “Particulate contamination: Sub-visible particles”) and the US Pharmacopoeia ([9] <788> Particulate matter in injections), adopts the harmonized general chapter and sets the control ranges for insoluble particulate matter of over 10 and 25 μm in diameter (Fig. 1). Accordingly, such insoluble particulate matter in a drug product should be controlled. Risk assessments should be undertaken and control ranges defined for insoluble particulate matter of a size outside the scope of the pharmacopoeia or for new materials not previously detected in drug products, if necessary.Fig. 1 Pharmacopoeia specifications of insoluble particulate matter and insoluble visible matter for injections



Insoluble Visible Matter (Visible Particle)
In this study, insoluble visible matter is defined as any visible impurity adhering to or embedded in the inside (process contact surface) or outside of a single-use component. Insoluble visible matter may be derived from a worker, airborne solids or components present in a manufacturing facility of single use suppliers. If peristaltic pumps are used, insoluble visible matter may be released from the tubing.Each pharmacopoeia lists the requirements for such insoluble visible matter, and drug products must meet these acceptance criteria; (e.g. Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) <6.06> “Foreign insoluble matter test for injections” [3], US Pharmacopoeia (USP) <790> “Visible particulates in injections” [10] and European Pharmacopoeia (EP) <2.9.20> “Particulate contamination: Visible particles” [14]). Control ranges for insoluble visible matter in manufacturing processes should be established while bearing in mind that the visible detection limits of insoluble visible matter depend on factors such as the environment in which the visual inspection is conducted and on the transparency of the single-use component.

Endotoxins and Microbes
Endotoxins and microorganisms are other impurities that could affect the drug substance/drug product and require control, particularly for injectables, where contamination with endotoxins and microorganisms could negatively impact the health of the patient.

Impact on CQAs
An additional quality-related event impacted by the use of single-use components is deviation of the CQAs of biologics from the appropriate limits, range and distribution. Possible deviations include reduced concentration of the contents due to adsorption to the single-use component, changes in aggregate content, changes in the molecular variant content of intended substances such as oxidants and changes in stability.

The magnitude of the risk (impact and uncertainty, or severity and likelihood) arising from the use of single-use components should be estimated for each CQA. Useful factors for estimating the level of risk include the chemical composition of the single-use component, the surface structure, the profile of extractables/leachables, content of endotoxins and microbes, material attributes such as the profile of insoluble particulate matter impurities, the extent of contact between the single-use component and the process (surface area, time, temperature, agitation), the pH and conductivity of the process solution, as well as the operational procedure. The magnitude of the risks relevant to the usage or quality of the single-use component should be compared to the risk criteria, and their acceptability should be justified. In this instance, the control range of CQAs is the risk acceptance criteria and the extent and frequency of deviation from the CQA control range may be considered in risk evaluation.

Impact on Stable Supply of Biologics
Another event affected by the use of single-use components is the stable supply of biologics. Factors that could impact the stable supply of biologics are the quality and proper usage of single-use components as well as the certainty of their supply chain.

Among the quality attributes of single-use components, the impact of integrity and sterility is potentially large. Leachables from single-use bags for cell culture can have a significant effect on cell growth and metabolism, and deviations in process control can be disruptive, thereby affecting the stable supply of biologics.

As for proper usage of single-use components, factors that could impact the stable supply of biologics include transportation, storage, unpacking, set-up, connection with connectors or other components, as well as the operations in the biologics manufacturing processes and the skill of the operators. In addition to a potential direct effect on manufacturing operations, these factors could also cause leaks, affect the integrity (seal performance) or sterility of single-use components, and indirectly impact stable supply as a result of contamination. Leaks resulting in a contamination of the manufacturing environment and possible exposure of the operator to hazards could also disrupt the stable supply of biologics.

Factors relevant to single-use component quality and usage should be identified, and risk assessments should be conducted to determine the need for relevant controls.

RISK CONTROL STRATEGIES
Risk control strategies should be determined on the basis of risk assessment to avoid hazards to health, discard or supply interruption of the biologics. For this purpose, it is useful to conduct a risk assessment or more specifically, identification, analysis and evaluate the risks in the manufacturing processes that affect the impurities or other CQA (previous section). Critical process steps and critical process parameters (CPP) should be identified to prioritize the requirements for controls.

Risk controls include various measures such as avoiding, mitigating and removing the source of the risks. One option for averting a health hazard is to avoid using any single-use components whose impact on health or whose leachables are uncertain, until further individual testing is done. Risks leading to out-of-specification results or delay of supply of biologics may be mitigated by judicial selection of appropriate single-use components, by setting their specifications, by carrying out appropriate design, evaluation, and control measures for their use in the manufacturing of biologics. If the combination of the quality control strategies for the single-use components and the manufacturing process of biologics are insufficient to avoid risk, it may be useful to also include the specifications for the drug substance/drug products. It is possible to confirm the validity of established manufacturing processes for biologics through process validation.

When selecting control methods, end users should take the severity, probability and detectability of deviations in process parameters into consideration. In general, it is preferable to establish multiple control methods for each CQA. When establishing control strategies, there should be cooperation between the R&D, process development, manufacturing and procurement departments of the biopharmaceutical industry, in addition to the quality department.

Selection of Appropriate Single-Use Components
To ensure the quality and stable supply of biologics after considering the abovementioned risks, it is important to choose single-use components suitable for the intended use, for which the certainty of supply and quality is assured. Since these issues primarily depend on controls determined by the supplier, it is important to obtain the suppliers’ relevant quality systems information and to select the single-use components whose quality has been appropriately evaluated and controlled.

The factors that should be taken into consideration include the structural design of the single-use component including the connector joints, raw material controls, manufacturing environment controls, manufacturing process controls, sterilization process controls, test procedures and reliability of results for extractables, test procedures and acceptance criteria for insoluble particulate matter and insoluble visible matter, shipping inspection, packaging/transport controls and change management/notification between the supplier and their sub-suppliers. It is important to select single-use components whose quality has been appropriately controlled, so that differences between individual components or lots do not affect the quality of biologics.

If raw materials such as stearate derived from bovine fat have been used in single-use component manufacturing processes, they should meet the animal-free requirement criteria (e.g. standard for biological ingredients in Japan). It is also critically important to control endotoxins, insoluble particulate matter and insoluble visible matter in single-use components used in the manufacture of drug product (Table I). Decisions to adopt single-use components should be made after taking into account the technical information, including the recommended conditions for use submitted by the supplier, since they may have lower physical strength compared to the materials used in conventional technologies such as stainless-steel components.Table I Examples of Points to Consider When Introducing Single-Use Components

Examples of lists to be assessed	Examples of issues to be assessed	
Structure design	Shape, layered structure for preventing leachables, compatibility with other components, structure for preventing misuse, strength	
Raw materials control	Monomers, polymerization initiators, metal catalysts, additives (antioxidants, lubricants, anti-adhesives, antistatics), adhesives, printing inks, solvents, and biological ingredients	
Manufacturing environment control	Air cleanliness, airborne microorganisms	
Manufacturing process control	Inspections upon receipt of materials and components, shape-forming, film-forming, bag-making, assembly, integrity test	
Sterilization process control	Radiation dosage (gamma- and beta-rays), level of ethylene oxide gas	
Quality control	Reliability of test procedure and analytical methods for extractables, test procedure and acceptance criteria for insoluble particulate matter	
Release test	Appearance, integrity test, consistency with the drawings, endotoxin test, inspection of foreign matters, sterility assurance	
Packaging and delivery control	Primary packaging, wrapping, transport	


Selection of single-use components should take into account the continuity of the supplier’s business and the existence of any appropriate alternative materials, if necessary. For single-use components fitted with sensors, attention should be paid to the performance of the sensor including the reliability of measurement, and the possibility that sensor constituents may affect the quality of biologics, as well as the possibility that sensor failure may impact the manufacturing process operations.

Where the single-use component is critical for the quality and stable supply of biologics, the supplier should be audited and the quality control systems in place should be checked periodically. It is also useful to prepare a quality contract incorporating such items as product standards/specifications of single-use component, manufacturing processes for single-use components that affect quality standards, record controls, storage conditions applicable to the end user, expiration dates, auditing, change controls, and the means of notifying the end user of changes (Table II).Table II Examples of Information Normally Disclosed to Users by Suppliers

Single-Use Component Specifications/User Requirement Specifications
Specifications for single-use components should be established in cooperation with the supplier, and for critical single-use components, the suitability of each lot should be evaluated. It is also useful to prepare documents listing the specific user requirement specifications for single-use components composed of multiple parts. For example, specifications may be set for insoluble particulate matter, endotoxins and sterility.

Receipt of Single-Use Components and Their Inspection Before Release for Use
In contrast to fixed equipment processes where the actual equipment is qualified and validated, in single-use systems, it is not possible to use the single-use component identical to the component that have been qualified in actual manufacturing process because each component is used only once. Therefore, it is necessary to check the component upon receipt and before releasing for use, so that differences between individual single-use components or lots do not impact the quality or manufacturability of biologics. Acceptance criteria similar to those applied to raw materials should be defined for the single-use components and applied before release for use. In setting the list of such inspection, the intended usage of single-use components in the biologics manufacturing process and its impact on the quality of biologics should be taken into consideration. Decisions concerning the inspection method and acceptance criteria should preferably be made jointly by the supplier and the end user to ensure maximum conformation to the requirements of the end user. Items that should be checked upon receipt include details of the shipping certificate, product labels, external appearance (visually check for breakage or adherence of foreign matter) and details of any irradiation certificate relevant for sterilization. To the extent possible, it should be confirmed that the materials conform to user requirement specifications and material specifications.

Inspection Before Release for Use
It is useful to determine storage conditions and to set inspection before use for single-use component, because breakage or contamination with insoluble visible matter and component interconnections may sometimes be difficult to detect at the time of receipt or may occur later during unpacking or storage. Items that should be checked before use, include the manufacture date (warranty period), storage conditions between receipt and use, conformity to set up and configuration specifications, breakage (e.g. visual inspection) and inspection for the presence of insoluble visible matter.

Qualification of the Single-Use System
Single-use system components should be evaluated as discussed in “Single-Use Component Specifications/User Requirement Specifications” section, and qualification should be carried out to confirm their suitability for the intended use. In addition, single-use systems in which single-use components are connected to fixed equipment/apparatus should undergo design qualification (DQ), installation qualification (IQ), operational qualification (OQ) and performance qualification (PQ). Single-use systems should also be checked for consistency with the intended design and requirement specifications, and their correct function within the expected operating range should be confirmed.

It should be noted that unlike fixed equipment or apparatus installed in manufacturing facilities, in single-use systems, single-use components identical to the component that have been used in qualification cannot be used in actual manufacturing. Attention should be paid to ensure differences between individual single-use components or lots do not impact the quality and manufacturability of biologics.

Design, Evaluation and Control of the Manufacturing Process for Biologics
Appropriate design, assessment and control of manufacturing processes of drug substance and drug product can reduce the possibility of deviation of CQAs and minimize contamination by impurities from the single-use components. One approach is to include a strategy for elimination of impurities in the downstream purification processes, although it is better to use single-use components without this concern.

For an identified leachable impacting the biologics quality and requiring control, it is useful to investigate the parameters and processes involved in both the generation and elimination of the leachable, as well as the probability and detectability of deviations of these processes and parameters. Factors that can affect the generation of leachables include the composition of the process solution, the extent of the contact with single-use components (surface area, time, temperature and agitation) and sterilization method such as gamma irradiation, while factors that can affect the elimination of leachables include purification processes such as chromatography and UF/DF process along with their process parameters. Thus, it is possible to control leachables by incorporating steps for their elimination in the design of the manufacturing process of biologics and setting the control range of process parameters and in-process testing. In some cases, it is necessary to flush single-use components before use to reduce the levels of not only residual insoluble particulate matter but also soluble leachables.

When single-use components were used in sterile process, it is also important to establish measures to ensure continued sterility during usage, seal integrity after connection to related process equipment, correct installation and the integrity of the filtration sterilization processes. In order to assure the integrity of the single-use components such as sterilization filters, testing/controls after use may be implemented, as necessary.

The mechanism by which the characteristics of single-use components affect the quality of biologics is not completely understood. Thus, single-use component-related impurities such as leachables and insoluble particulate matter may affect the quality of biologics but be undetected by current analyses. Therefore, in addition to the single-use component quality controls discussed here, consistency of the manufacturing process of biologics is also important.

Specifications of Biologics
In addition to selecting appropriate single-use components and biologics manufacturing process controls, it is also useful to establish specifications for the drug substance/drug product with respect to residual single-use components-related impurities or other CQAs, if necessary. Defining the specifications prevents the release of lots with out-of-specification with regard to residual impurities or other CQAs.

Appropriate Training When Using Single-Use Component
Because single-use equipment is often operated manually, human error in unpacking, connecting, installation, and operation of biologics manufacturing processes may affect the stable supply and/or quality of the biologics. To avoid human error, training systems should be implemented and standard operational procedures should be provided to the operators. It is also useful for end users and suppliers to jointly undertake periodic operator training, with the additional aim of upgrading technology, including knowledge and automated systems, as appropriate.

Communication Between Single-Use Suppliers and End Users
It is preferable for the suppliers to disclose as much information as possible regarding the source of chemicals and the quality controls of the single-use components. If possible, it is also preferable that the end user should disclose the purpose of the single-use components in the biologics manufacturing process to the supplier in order to avoid problems arising from invalidated use. Communication between suppliers and end users can be useful to confirm the appropriateness of selection and usage of the single-use components employed in manufacturing processes of biologics (Tables II and III).Table III Examples of Information Normally Disclosed to Suppliers by Users

Deviation Control
There are known incidents involving single-use components, such as content leakage, although the frequency may be low. Since manual operation is more common with single-use systems than with conventional fixed equipment, technical proficiency, such as in the assembling of components, is necessary to avoid even infrequent incidents such as content leakage. The appropriate responses in cases of deviations, such as leakage or misconnection, should be set out beforehand in accordance with the companies’ established and GMP-compliant deviation handling standard operation procedure (SOP). In the event of a deviation, measures should be taken in accordance with the procedure, and corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) should also be taken, as appropriate and the choice of component should be reevaluated.

LIFE CYCLE AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT
In the life cycle management of biologics manufactured using single-use systems, it is important to continually assess whether the system employed is being operated as intended and whether improvements or changes are required. In addition, change controls are an important factor in life cycle management even if single-use components are used, because many changes occur in manufacturing processes of biologics due to scale changes in manufacture or implementation of new technologies.

Possible changes at end users of single-use components include a change of suppliers of the single-use components, a change in a single-use component from the same supplier as well as a change in the use of a single-use component. A risk assessment of the impact on the quality of the biologics should be undertaken for each change, in light of information provided by the supplier and the comparability assessed with reference to the ICH Q5E guidelines, as necessary.

Possible changes in the single-use component supplier include changes in the raw materials, parts used, place of manufacture, manufacturing processes, sterilization processes, quality testing, acceptance criteria of release test, packaging and delivery. It is necessary for end users and suppliers to establish in advance what changes might affect the quality of single-use components, with consideration given to an adequate period to investigate the effects of the change. Lot control is required for single-use components as for raw materials and forms part of the control measures imposed on biopharmaceutical industries.

In order to avoid any unexpected deleterious impact on quality attribute due to the changes, suppliers and end users should interact throughout the life cycle of the biologics concerning the quality and purpose for use of the single-use components. An agreement should be clearly established indicating that information relevant to any implemented changes will be provided. Collaboration between suppliers and end users is also recommended in order to ensure a continual improvement of biopharmaceutical quality throughout the biologics life cycle. For such purpose, end users should perform supplier audits periodically to ensure that the suppliers have an appropriate quality system.

CONCLUSION
Our intention is that this study will be useful in promoting the development of biologics as well as in ensuring their safety, quality and stable supply.

Adrenal scintigraphy with 131I-6β-iodomethylnorcholesterol is considered by several authors the gold standard for assessing tumors with subclinical hypercortisolemia. However, most of the described series consist mainly of cases with unilateral lesions. The aim of our study was to assess whether scintigraphy is useful in choosing the adrenalectomy side in the case of bilateral adrenal tumors with subclinical hypercortisolemia.

Methods
The study focused on 15 consecutive patients with benign bilateral adrenal tumors and subclinical hypercortisolemia. The scintigraphy with 131I-6β-iodomethylnorcholesterol was performed. Fourteen patients underwent unilateral adrenalectomy; the gland with predominant uptake on scintigraphy was removed. Cortisol and ACTH concentrations were measured one and six months after surgery. Post-dexamethasone cortisolemia was assessed six months after surgery. To date, the patients have been under postoperative observation for 1–4 years.

Results
Four patients showed unilateral uptake of radiotracer, and nine patients showed predominant accumulation of radiotracer in one of the adrenal glands. The smaller tumor was predominant in 2 cases. Percentage of activity on the predominant side correlates positively with the difference between tumors’ diameters. Unilateral uptake of radiotracer predicts long-lasting postoperative insufficiency of the second adrenal gland. Excision of predominating tumor led to cessation of hypercortisolemia in all patients.

Conclusions
The corticoadrenal scintigraphy is useful in choosing the side for operation in the case of bilateral adrenal tumors with subclinical hypercortisolemia.

==== Body
Corticoadrenal scintigraphy (just as with every form of scintigraphy) does not provide a perfect view on morphology of the examined area and fails against other imaging examinations in this respect. However, it should be expected first of all that scintigraphy provides an assessment of the examined tumor’s function after a precise assessment of tumor morphology by X-ray computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Scintigraphic imaging of the activity of tumors originating from the adrenal cortex may complement or sometimes even replace catheterization of adrenal veins in the case of aldosteronoma [1], but it seems to be most useful in assessing cortisol-producing adenomas of the adrenal fascicular zone. Scintigraphy was considered the gold standard for assessing adrenal tumors by several authors [2–4]; however, nowadays, it is seldom used in diagnostics of incidentalomas. The cholesterol derivative radiotracer, 131I-6β-iodomethylnorcholesterol ([131I]-NP-59) accumulates bilaterally in healthy adrenal glands and unilaterally in hormonally active adrenal adenomas or carcinomas [5]. Planar radiographic technique with analysis of the regions of interest (ROI) is the standard method of interpretation. A less frequently employed but more accurate method is using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). SPECT imaging may be useful, in particular, in the diagnostics of ectopic adrenal glands, relapses at the postoperative site or hormonally active metastases, i.e., when an accurate imaging of the radiotracer accumulation site is needed. After completion of a dedicated CT or MRI of adrenal region, if there is still need to confirm tumor hormonal activity, radionuclide scintigraphy will be sufficient imaging modality [2, 5, 6].

Bilateral tumors constitute about 15% of incidentally detected adrenal tumors [2, 7, 8]. They may cause overt clinical or subclinical hypercortisolemia. Some authors state that they have found a higher incidence of subclinical Cushing’s syndrome among patients with benign phenotype bilateral adrenal tumors compared to patients with unilateral lesions [2, 8, 9].

Correct approval for surgical treatment is particularly difficult in case of bilateral lesions. There can only be hormonal activity in one of the tumors; thus, it pays to work out a method for unmistakably identifying the hormonally active tumor that enables a unilateral instead of bilateral adrenalectomy to be performed. Catheterization of adrenal veins with determination of the concentration gradient between them would be the best method in such cases [10, 11]. However, it is an invasive procedure, and patients with hypercortisolemia are more at risk of complications, i.e., thrombosis in the catheterized vessel or damage of the vessel, than others [12]. In the case of bilateral lesions, it is most often assumed that the larger tumor is the hormonally active one; however, the dimensions of tumors differ slightly in some patients. For assessment of incidentalomas, some researchers have carried out radio-labeled norcholesterol scintigraphies that correlated well with adrenal cortex function [2–4], but in the series described in their papers most of the tumors (85–95%) were unilateral lesions.

The aim of our study was to assess whether scintigraphy is useful in choosing the adrenalectomy side in the case of incidentally detected bilateral adrenal tumors with subclinical hypercortisolemia.

Materials and methods
The material consisted of 15 patients with incidentally discovered bilateral adrenal tumors and subclinical hypercortisolemia. CT image phenotypes definitely corresponded to benign lesions in all the subjects: the values of attenuation on unenhanced scans were <10 HU (−19 to +8 HU). None of the patients had evident somatic features of hypercortisolemia, however, 13 patients had hypertension, 5 had diabetes mellitus, and 10 had hyperlipidemia. The adopted criterion for the diagnosis of subclinical hypercortisolemia was a cortisolemia of >3 mcg/dl after a dexamethasone suppression test and ACTH concentration of <10 pg/ml (according to criteria proposed by Eller Vanicher and coauthors [13]). Subclinical hyperaldosteronism was ruled out by a calculation of the PAC/PRA ratio and congenital adrenocortical hyperplasia by a determination of the 17-OH-progesterone (17-OHP) concentration. Considering the possibility of mixed tumors of the adrenal cortex and medulla, all patients underwent a determination of 24-h urinary excretion of methoxycatecholamines, which ruled out subclinical catecholamine hypersecretion. Scintigraphy was performed 72 h after intravenous administration of the radiotracer, and, in the case of weak accumulation of the radiotracer, an additional time after 144 h. No patients with subclinical hypercortisolemia underwent initial suppression with dexamethasone before scintigraphy. Thyroid iodine uptake was blocked by oral administration of Lugol’s solution for 2 days. This examination was assessed with a semi-quantitative method. The uptake patterns were classified into four types:type 1—no radiotracer uptake in the adrenal glands;

type 2—unilateral uptake without accumulation on the contralateral side (100/0%).

type 3—bilateral uptake with distinctly predominant one side (>66% of total activity): “predominant” = 66–75% of total activity on the predominant side (70% was assumed for calculations); “markedly predominant” = >75% of total activity on the predominant side (85% was assumed for calculations);

type 4—bilateral symmetric uptake (L = R) (radiotracer uptake of 50% in each tumor was assumed for calculations).



To evaluate the correlation between percent of uptake and tumor diameters/hormone concentrations we used Pearson’s analysis of correlation. Values were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05. The calculations were performed by STATISTICA™.

Fourteen patients in the tested group underwent unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The adrenal gland with predominant uptake on scintigraphy was operated, irrespectively whether it harbored the larger tumor or not. In cases with symmetric uptake, the larger tumor was operated. Hydrocortisone was administered parenterally at a dose of 150–200 mg/day on the day of surgery and on day 1 and day 2, and then the treatment was continued using an oral 30-mg/day administered in two divided doses. The dose was tapered down individually according to patient’s clinical state (usually by 5 mg every 1–2 weeks) at ambulatory visits.

During the second month after surgery, 24 h after the last dose of hydrocortisone, a determination of cortisol and ACTH concentration was carried out at 0800 h and of cortisol at 2200 h, and then these concentrations were determined half a year after surgery and every year from then on. The dexamethasone suppression test with cortisol concentration measurement was performed half a year after surgery, then every year thereafter. The patients have been under postoperative observation for one (two patients) to 4 years (7 patients), none of them had the recurrence of hypercortisolemia.

Results
Four patients (27%) showed only unilateral uptake with no radiotracer accumulation in the contralateral adrenal gland 72 h after the administration of radiotracer (Fig. 1). Predominant accumulation (>66% of total activity) was demonstrated in one of the adrenal glands in nine patients (60%) (Fig. 2). The uptake was symmetric in two patients (13%). The larger tumor was the predominant one on scintigraphy in 11 cases, but predominant uptake was present in the smaller tumor with trace accumulation on the contralateral side in two patients. A smaller by 1-cm tumor was predominant in one case and smaller by 2.3 cm tumor in another case (Fig. 3).Fig. 1 Unilateral uptake of the tracer in the right adrenal gland (with the bigger tumor). a CT (the arrows point to the both tumors); b anterior planar view of scintigraphic study; c posterior planar view.

From an analysis of correlations it appeared that the percentage of activity on the predominant side correlates positively but weakly with the difference between tumors’ diameters (r = 0.43; P = 0.06). After the exclusion from the analysis of two patients with predominant uptake in the smaller tumor, the correlation became stronger (r = 0.62; P = 0.02) (Fig. 4). The percentage of activity did not correlate with tumor size nor cortisol nor ACTH concentrations.Fig. 4 Percentage of activity on the predominant side correlates positively with the difference between diameters of the tumors.



Uptake in scintigraphy and postoperative function of the adrenal gland
Unilateral uptake of radio-labeled norcholesterol with complete uptake inhibition in the contralateral adrenal gland was found in four patients (27%). The uptake was present in the larger (by 1.2–4.5 cm) tumor in all the cases. The cortisol concentration after the dexamethasone suppression test was on average 6.15 ± 1.2 mcg/dl in these patients and did not differ significantly from that in the other patients. One of these patients refused surgery. Half a year after surgery, three patients with unilateral uptake still presented with postoperative insufficiency of the other adrenal gland, whereas the other patients who were operated on already had normal adrenal function. A secondary hypofunction of the remaining adrenal gland was diagnosed based on persisting inhibition of ACTH (<10 pg/ml), low concentrations of cortisol (<10 mcg/dl in the morning), low 24-h urinary excretion of cortisol (<25 mcg/day), and 17-hydroxy-corticosteroids (<2.2 mg/day) and clinical symptoms (muscular pains, nausea, hypotension during an attempt to withdraw hydrocortisone). Normal concentrations of ACTH and cortisol were found only 2 years after surgery in these patients.

Predominant uptake on one side with a slight uptake in the contralateral adrenal gland was detected in nine patients (60%). Predominant uptake in the larger (by at least 1 cm) tumor (1.1–3 cm) occurred in five patients, whereas in two patients predominant uptake was present in the smaller (by 1 and 2.3 cm) tumor. In two persons, predominant uptake was detected in the tumor that was only slightly larger in diameter (a difference of 0.5 and 0.6 cm, respectively). The concentrations of cortisol were low (<10 mcg/dl), and the concentrations of ACTH still remained below the lower normal range (i.e., below 10 pg/ml) in all patients during the second month after surgery. Therefore, a strategy consisting of a gradual hydrocortisone dose decrease was employed. None of the patients had a secondary adrenocortical insufficiency after the withdrawal of hydrocortisone half a year after surgery.

Symmetric bilateral uptake was found in two patients (13%) in whom the difference between tumors’ diameters was 0.3 and 1 cm. The larger tumor was operated on first. These patients had no secondary adrenal insufficiency after the adrenalectomy, In one of them, after 6 months, the ACTH concentration was low, and the cortisol concentration was too high (3.6 mcg/dl) after dexamethasone suppression test. This patient gained weight of 5 kg and, as before surgery, has treatment-resistant arterial hypertension. Repeated scintigraphy during the administration of dexamethasone showed radiotracer uptake in the non-operated left adrenal gland. As histology revealed a nodular hyperplasia in the excised right adrenal gland, the surgeon decided to perform a total adrenalectomy. A reduction in arterial pressure values and a continuous loss of body mass (12 kg in total during 2 years) was achieved after the second surgical procedure; this patient receives at present 15–20 mg of hydrocortisone daily.

Proper cortisol concentrations after dexamethasone suppression were found after the consecutive 1 and 2 years in all patients.

Discussion
Correct clinical evaluation and exact analysis of hormonal tests carried out in the patients before surgery warrant effectiveness of the operation. In considering the criteria for approval of surgical treatment in patients with subclinical hypercortisolemia, Eler-Vainicher emphasizes that postoperative secondary insufficiency of the other adrenal gland is definitive proof of tumor hormonal activity [14]. The majority of papers regarding the indication to adrenalectomy discuss the hormonal criteria which must be fulfilled to make a decision about surgery. At least two of the following abnormal results should be found: a cortisol concentration of >3 mcg/dl after dexamethasone, an ACTH concentration of <10 pg/ml, a cortisol concentration of >4 mcg/dl at midnight, and 24-h urinary excretion of free cortisol of >70 mcg [13, 15–17]. In our study, we decided to use the first two hormonal criteria as the simplest ones with respect to execution and repetition, as well as in ambulatory settings. However, even an unquestionable diagnosis of hypercortisomia in the case of bilateral tumors did not ensure successful surgery because the lateralization of secretory function still remained unclear.

Accumulation of radiolabelled norcholesterol in the adrenal glands is evidence of adrenocortical hormonal activity. Therefore, we considered scintigraphy to be potentially valuable for choosing the adrenal gland for surgery in the case of bilateral lesions and subclinical hypercortisolemia. Scintigraphy was considered to be the gold standard for assessing incidentalomas by several authors [2–4]; however, in the series described in their papers, most of the tumors (85–95%) were unilateral lesions. A unilateral radiotracer uptake was found in all the cases of cortisol concentration of >5 mcg/dl after dexamethasone suppression test and such uptake predicted insufficiency of the second adrenal gland after surgery [2, 3]. In our study, a postoperative insufficiency of the second adrenal gland lasting two years occurred in 3 of 4 patients with only unilateral uptake (the fourth person refused surgery), and the preoperative cortisol concentration after dexamethasone suppression test was above 5 mcg/dl in three of these patients. Furthermore, postoperative decrease in cortisolemia did not occur in the two cases of bilateral uptake, and a deteriorated clinical state (increment of body mass, poor control of arterial hypertension), an abnormal dexamethasone suppression test, and a low concentration of ACTH 6 months after surgery were the indication for the second adrenalectomy in one of these patients. On the other hand, the other patient with symmetric radiotracer uptake in whom hydrocortisone was already discontinued during the second month after surgery did not require repeated surgery. Her post-dexamethasone cortisol concentration was borderline (2.6 mcg/dl), and neither an inhibition of ACTH release nor deteriorated general condition was observed in this patient. The above finding is consistent with the results of several studies in which an improvement of the clinical state following the removal of one of the tumors was observed even in the presence of symmetric uptake on scintigraphy without postoperative insufficiency of the other adrenal gland; thus, the hormonal function was certainly bilateral before surgery [18, 19].

In the group described by Iacobone that consisted of seven patients with differences between tumors’ diameters of >2 cm who underwent resection of the adrenal gland harboring the larger tumor and showing predominant uptake of labeled norcholesterol, a marked clinical improvement was achieved in six patients, including two patients with permanent secondary insufficiency of the other adrenal gland [18]. The surgical treatment was not successful in case of similar dimensions of enlarged adrenals, which was accompanied with symmetric uptake of NP-59. The correlation between the percentage of radiotracer uptake by the predominant adrenal gland on scintigraphy and the difference between tumors’ diameters discovered by us also supports the thesis that the greater the difference between lesions’ dimensions, the greater the difference in secretory activity. However, in individual cases the bigger size was not always evidence of tumor secretory activity: in two patients smaller tumors were predominant on scintigraphy (difference between diameters of 2.3 and 1 cm), and in two other patients the only slightly larger tumor was predominant (difference 0.6 and 0.5 cm). The literature regarding bilateral adrenal tumors indicated that tumors larger by at least 1 cm should be operated on when unilateral adrenalectomy is performed [18–20]; thus, the non-secreting side would be operated in the two first persons. If the difference between diameters is less than 1 cm, a selective bilateral excision of fragments of adrenal glands harboring focal lesions is often performed [21–23]; however, execution of such a surgical procedure in two patients would be unnecessary. In addition, histopathological examination showed a macronodular hyperplasia in these female patients; thus, they were at high risk of new focal lesions in the remaining fragments of adrenal glands.

Conclusion
Corticoadrenal scintigraphy is useful in choosing the operation side in the case of bilateral adrenal tumors with subclinical hypercortisolemia. Unilateral radiotracer uptake on scintigraphy predicts a long-lasting insufficiency of the other adrenal gland after surgery.

Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) is a useful tool in assessing the transmural and extraintestinal lesions in Crohn’s disease (CD). However, the influence of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy on MRE features of CD severity remains unknown. The purpose of the study was to assess the short- and long-term changes in MRE features of CD activity in relation to CD clinical course in patients treated with anti-TNF antibodies.

Methods
 The influence on the most important parameters of CD activity seen in MRE was assessed retrospectively using a validated score. Patients were treated with anti-TNF agents and the clinical, laboratory, and MRE CD activity was estimated at baseline, after the induction therapy and after 1 year of treatment.

Results
71 patients were enrolled in a study. The change in CD clinical activity correlated significantly with fluctuations in MRE activity score (P < 0.0001, r = 0.5 for induction; P = 0.004, r = 0.7 for maintenance anti-TNF therapy, respectively). Bowel wall thickening, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and fat wrapping with vascular proliferation were MRE parameters which changed significantly both after the induction and maintenance treatment in patients responding to the therapy. The change in MRE activity score was mostly pronounced during the first 3 months of treatment, when compared to the continuation of the therapy till week 52–54 (−6 points vs. −2 points, respectively; P = 0.0008).

Conclusions
 Transmural and extraintestinal healing seen in MRE correlates with changes in CD clinical activity during anti-TNF therapy, thus MRE seems to be a useful tool in monitoring the efficacy of biological agents.

In recent years, magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) has become one of the most important diagnostic methods in the assessment of Crohn’s disease (CD) activity [1]. Due to its non-invasiveness, it can be performed multiple times in the same patient, what enables the dynamic estimation of disease progression or regression in time [2].

Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF) antibodies are novel potent anti-inflammatory drugs in CD [3]. Nevertheless, it is still a matter of debate, how to monitor the course of anti-TNF therapy. Endoscopy is believed to be a gold standard; however, due to its invasiveness it is questionable to repeat this investigation in a short period of time in all patients [3]. That is why it seems that MRE could be a valuable alternative for endoscopic assessment, and in the case of small bowel CD—even a method of choice for dynamic monitoring of the course of anti-TNF therapy. Moreover, MRE also seems to be the most accurate tool in determining so called transmural healing in CD, as it allows to visualize all layers of the gut wall [4]. However, taking into account a broad spectrum of inflammatory intestinal and extraintestinal CD manifestations in MRE, there are still few data concerning the direct influence of anti-TNF therapy on radiological parameters of CD activity. That is why, due to an increasing role of MRE in diagnostics of CD, there is an urgent need to determine which morphological changes in the inflamed intestines result from anti-TNF therapy. This could help in a better understanding of the mechanisms of the action of biological agents, and it would provide important data on the definition of transmural and extraintestinal healing, as there are still many difficulties in defining this phenomenon. Thus, the main aim of the current study is to assess which radiological features of CD severity in MRE are mostly influenced by anti-TNF antibodies in relation to the efficacy of biological therapy.

Patients and methods
We retrospectively analysed data from patients with diagnosed CD, who were treated with anti-TNF agents in years 2009–2014 in our department. All patients were treated according to the current therapeutic guidelines with either adalimumab (ADA) or infliximab (IFX) [5]. ADA was administered in the following doses: 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, 40 mg every other week till week 12 (7 induction doses), and then in patients responding to induction therapy—40 mg every other week till week 52. IFX was administered in the doses of 5 mg/kg body weight at week 0, 2, 6 (3 induction doses), and then in patients responding to induction therapy—every 8 weeks till week 52. Response to the induction therapy was defined clinically as a decrease in Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) by 100 points or more. Clinical remission was defined as CDAI < 150 points [6].

The inclusion criteria were as follows:Qualification for biological therapy because of CD flare (as assessed by CDAI) not responding to standard medical therapy. Standard medical therapy was defined as therapeutic and stable doses of steroids (1 mg of prednisolone/kg body weight) for at least 3 weeks, and/or azathioprine (AZA—2–2.5 mg/kg body weight), and/or mesalamine (4 g daily) for at least 12 weeks.

Ileal or ileocolonic CD location.

Performance of MRE twice: at baseline—up to 3 weeks before starting anti-TNF therapy, and after induction doses of biological agents: at week 12–14 in the case of ADA and at week 9–12 in the case of IFX. Only MRE investigations performed with the same protocol were taken into account. When possible, also MRE studies performed after 1 year of anti-TNF therapy were analysed.



Exclusion criteria:Isolated colonic CD.

Significant changes in therapeutic regimens of anti-TNF therapy defined above or in the concomitant treatment, like for example, the introduction of a new drug, a change in the dose of immunosuppressant. Only tapering of steroids after finishing the induction phase of anti-TNF therapy or discontinuation of antibiotics were allowed in patients responding to the biological treatment.

Previous anti-TNF therapy <12 weeks before enrolment to the current analysis.



Clinical activity was assessed by CDAI. The severity of endoscopic lesions was estimated by calculating Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES-CD) [7]. Both SES-CD and CDAI were calculated prospectively. Biochemical activity was assessed in parallel.

MRE studies were performed with the same protocol as described previously [8]. Patients fasted for 6 h before MRE. 30–40 min before scanning, patients were administered 1500 ml of oral polyethylene glycol. Fifteen minutes before the procedure, 40 mg of buscolysin was injected intravenously in order to reduce bowel motility. The study protocol consisted of the following sequences:true fast imaging with steady-state free precession sequences in the coronal and transverse planes,

single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences with fat suppression in the coronal plane,

cine loop coronal images for the visualization of the bowel movements and stenosis,

fat-suppressed 3D T1-weighted Volumetric Interpolated Breath-Hold Examination and T1-weighted 3D Fast Low Angle Shot technique before and three times—30, 90 s, and 5 min—after intravenous injection of gadolinium contrast (dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight followed by 20 ml of saline).



All MRE investigations were assessed by a radiologist with more than 12 years of experience in this cross-sectional imaging technique. All studies were blinded for the radiologist and then randomly analysed and quantified using the grading score called the Simple Enterographic Activity Score for Crohn’s Disease (SEAS-CD), whose diagnostic utility was previously proved in an independent cohort of CD patients by Eder et al. [8]. This score consists of the most important features reflecting CD activity, which were quantified depending on their intensity and they formed the final SEAS-CD result (Table 1).Table 1 Simple Enterographic Activity Score for Crohn’s Disease (SEAS-CD) [8] All variables are calculated separately for jejunum and ileum, and in the next step they are summed up

aFat wrapping and proliferation of mesenteric vasculature scores were summed up, as those phenomena are strictly interrelated and they are assessed together



As the first step, we determined the influence of induction doses of anti-TNF agents on CD activity assessed in MRE. We compared changes in the most important radiological features of CD activity in patients who responded to the therapy (defined as a decrease in CDAI by 100 points—the responders group) with patients who were primary non-responders. Then the influence of long-term anti-TNF therapy was also analysed by comparing MRE results after induction doses of biological agents with MRE CD activity scores after 1 year (at week 52–54) of treatment.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means with standard deviations (SD). Correlation analyses between selected parameters were performed with the use of Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Statistical differences were calculated using Student t test (parametric) when conditions of normality and equal variance were met. When the normality test failed, the Wilcoxon test or Mann–Whitney test was used for paired or unpaired groups, respectively. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant. All data were analysed using the GraphPad Prism Version 6.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., USA).

Anti-TNF induction therapy
53 patients (75%) were primary responders, whereas 18 (25%) did not respond to the induction doses of anti-TNF antibodies. The change in CDAI scores in the whole study group (n = 71) correlated significantly with fluctuations in SEAS-CD scores during induction anti-TNF therapy (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 The correlation between the change in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Simple Enterographic Activity Score for Crohn’s Disease (SEAS-CD) during the induction anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy.



In the responders group there was a significant decrease in CDAI: 272 ± 90 vs. 94 ± 54 points (P < 0.0001), as well as a significant reduction of CD activity assessed in MRE—SEAS-CD decreased from 14 ± 5 to 8 ± 4 points (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2A). We noted also a statistically significant change in high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration—17.3 ± 25.6 vs. 3.6 ± 4.3 mg/l (P < 0.0001), hematocrit—37 ± 5 vs. 39 ± 5% (P = 0.01), hemoglobin concentration—12.2 ± 1.9 vs. 13.1 ± 1.8 g/dl (P = 0.001), platelet count—357 ± 105 vs. 302 ± 76 103/mm3 (P < 0.0001), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate—27 ± 19 vs. 19 ± 17 mm/h (P = 0.001).Fig. 2 The change in the Simple Enterographic Activity Score for Crohn’s Disease (SEAS-CD) in the responders (A) and non-responders (B) group after induction anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. Data are presented as means with standard deviations.



Almost all parameters of MRE CD activity decreased significantly after induction anti-TNF therapy in the responders group (Fig. 3A). Figure 4 shows examples of the influence of induction anti-TNF therapy on selected features of CD inflammatory activity seen in MRE among primary responders.Fig. 3 The change in the parameters of Crohn’s disease activity assessed in magnetic resonance enterography after induction anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy in the responders group (A) and non-responders group (B).

The diameter of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes decreased significantly after the therapy (F).



In the non-responders group CDAI did not change significantly after anti-TNF induction therapy: 275 ± 71 vs. 212 ± 77 points. Mean SEAS-CD values only slightly decreased in the course of biological therapy—15 ± 5 vs. 14 ± 5 points (Fig. 2B); however, taking into account the different distribution of variables before and after treatment, it reached the statistical significance (P = 0.02).

In the non-responders group, we also noted a statistically significant change in hsCRP concentration—27.1 ± 23.4 vs. 17.3 ± 27.7 mg/l (P = 0.04), platelet count—401 ± 130 vs. 349 ± 95 103/mm3 (P = 0.01), and white blood cell count—6.5 ± 3.3 vs. 5.7 ± 2.7 103/mm3 (P = 0.03). Other laboratory parameters did not change significantly.

There was a significant decrease only in fat wrapping and vascular proliferation after anti-TNF induction therapy in patients who did not respond to the treatment. Other parameters did not change or decreased without achieving statistical significance (Fig. 3B).

Comparison of SEAS-CD between responders and non-responders group
Baseline SEAS-CD scores were not statistically different when compared the responders and non-responders group (14 ± 5 vs. 15 ± 5 points, respectively; P = 0.09). All assessed parameters of MRE CD activity were comparable between the two aforementioned groups.

After finishing the induction phase of anti-TNF therapy, SEAS-CD among non-responders was significantly higher when compared with the responders group (14 ± 5 vs. 8 ± 4 points, respectively; P < 0.0001). Almost all parameters of MRE CD activity were significantly higher among non-responders after induction doses of anti-TNF antibodies (Fig. 5).Fig. 5 The differences in the variables assessed in magnetic resonance enterography after the induction phase of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy between the responders group and patients primarily not responding to treatment. Data are presented as means with standard deviations.



One-year anti-TNF therapy
In 17 patients, MRE investigation was performed three times: at week 0, after anti-TNF induction therapy, and after 1 year of treatment. When compared CDAI and SEAS-CD scores after biological induction therapy and after 1 year of treatment, changes in those parameters correlated significantly (P = 0.004; r = 0.7). In this subgroup of patients—13 of them were in clinical remission (CDAI < 150) at week 52–54 of biological therapy; 4 patients were secondary non-responders (CDAI ≥ 150).

In patients with a long-term remission, there was a further, statistically significant improvement in CD MRE activity observed: SEAS-CD decreased from 9 ± 4 points after induction therapy to 5 ± 3 points at week 52–54 (P = 0.02). The decrease in SEAS-CD score was mainly due to further reduction in bowel wall thickening (P = 0.01), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (P = 0.03), and fat wrapping with vascular proliferation (P = 0.05, borderline significance). Other assessed MRE features did not change or improved without statistical significance.

In the subgroup of secondary non-responders, SEAS-CD increased from 6 ± 3 points to 10 ± 3 points; however, without statistical significance. All MRE features of CD activity assessed by SEAS-CD score increased after 1-year anti-TNF therapy without achieving statistical significance.

Discussion
Objective assessment of the influence of anti-TNF therapy on the inflammatory activity of CD seems to be crucial for the proper monitoring of the treatment outcomes [9]. There are only few studies assessing the ability of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques to determine the transmural and extraintestinal healing in CD patients treated with anti-TNF agents. First data in this subject concerned MR techniques that were similar, but methodologically different than MRE. Tielback et al. showed in their retrospective analysis including 50 CD patients that the inflammatory scores assessed in MR imaging improved only in individuals, who responded to the therapy [10]. Van Assche and colleagues performed a multicentre prospective trial, in which magnetic resonance enteroclysis was performed at baseline of anti-TNF treatment, and then at week 2 and 6 months after starting infliximab [11]. Finally, 15 patients were assessed at weeks 2 and 26. The analysis revealed that a decrease of the activity of inflammatory components occurred from 2 weeks after beginning of the therapy. At week 26, the magnetic resonance enteroclysis index improved in 80% of patients; however, only in 13% of them a complete absence of CD activity was noted.

In the most recent study performed by Ordas et al., the accuracy of MRE in determining the clinical response and mucosal healing in CD patients treated with anti-TNF agents were assessed for the first time [12]. This was a prospective multicentre study in which 48 patients were included, and they underwent ileocolonoscopy (as a reference standard) and MRE at baseline and 12 weeks after starting corticosteroids or anti-TNF therapy. The analysis revealed that the change in the MRE activity estimated with the use of Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA) determined with 90% accuracy the mucosal healing effect and with 83% accuracy—the endoscopic remission [13].

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the second one in which the utility of MRE in reflecting the influence of anti-TNF therapy on CD activity was assessed, and it includes the largest cohort of CD patients so far. Our analysis revealed that MRE CD activity changes in parallel with fluctuations of CD clinical activity during both—the induction (short-term) and 1-year (long-term) anti-TNF therapy. Almost all parameters assessed routinely in MRE are improving in patients clinically responding to the therapy in parallel to the majority of the laboratory results. Only intraabdominal fistulas were still present after treatment, what is to be expected, as this structural complication of CD is rather an indication for surgery [14]. However, in rare cases other therapeutic options are chosen, as not all patients accept surgery. The second and more frequent scenario is that patients underwent intestinal resection in the past and surgery has to be avoided in order to prevent irreversible complications after multiple intestinal resections, like for example, the short bowel syndrome. That is why some minor proportion of CD patients with intraabdominal fistulas is treated non-surgically, and anti-TNF therapy seems to be the most effective choice in these cases [14].

Although statistical analysis showed, that SEAS-CD decreased also in the non-responders group, this change was significantly less pronounced when compared with patients with CDAI-100 response. The decrease in SEAS-CD in patients not responding to the therapy was a consequence of a slight improvement in the minority of SEAS-CD variables; only fat wrapping with vascular proliferation decreased significantly. However, comparison of SEAS-CD scores after the induction anti-TNF therapy shows a significant and very pronounced difference between responders and non-responders group. Moreover, the majority of MRE variables differ significantly in these two groups of patients after the induction therapeutic period (Fig. 5), what shows that SEAS-CD reliably reflects the course of CD during biological therapy.

Nevertheless, considering only the non-responders group, anti-TNF treatment leads to transmural and extraintestinal healing to some extent, as well as there is also some improvement in single laboratory tests. However, these phenomena are insufficient to be reflected by regression of CD clinical activity. This is a very interesting phenomenon which was confirmed even on a molecular level. In the study by Leal et al. it was shown that also in patients not responding to the anti-TNF therapy, a big amount of inflammatory parameters involved in CD pathogenesis significantly decreased, although this was not reflected by the improvement of clinical status of the patients [15]. These data and our results suggest that CD symptomatology assessed by CDAI is influenced by multiple pathogenic factors, and only a complex, multifactorial improvement provides clinical response.

Analysis of the long-term influence of anti-TNF therapy also shows that changes in MRE CD activity parameters correlate with the clinical efficacy of biological agents. Comparative analysis shows that in the case of patients achieving a long-term response to the therapy, the degree of SEAS-CD reduction is significantly more pronounced during the first 3 months of treatment (induction therapy) than during maintenance anti-TNF treatment (mean change in SEAS-CD = −6 points vs −2 points, respectively; P = 0.0008). These data show that the strongest potential of anti-TNF agents to induce transmural and extraintestinal healing concerns the first, early period of treatment. Thus, it can be hypothesized, that the degree of the healing effect achieved during the induction anti-TNF therapy is a predictor of further treatment’s efficacy. However, it should be mentioned that even after 1 year of biological therapy, there was only one case of a complete recovery from inflammatory lesions seen in MRE (1/13–8% of patients in the long-term remission; data not shown).

In contrast to the induction anti-TNF therapy, which improved almost all MRE parameters of CD activity in the responders group, further clinically successive treatment results only in the significant decrease of bowel wall thickening, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and fat wrapping with vascular proliferation; however, these data should be interpreted with caution due to a low number of patients experiencing the loss of response to anti-TNF agents. Nevertheless, it can be hypothesized that the aforementioned MRE parameters are mostly influenced by anti-TNF antibodies, and they are responsible to the greatest extent for transmural and extraintestinal healing phenomenon. The question that needs to be answered is whether these observations could be indirectly translated into hypotheses on the mechanisms and primary sites of action of anti-TNF agents. This could be very problematic, however, according to the latest reports on the pathogenesis of inflammatory lesions in CD, it is suggested that one of the crucial roles is played by the mesenteric adipose tissue in which significant vascular proliferation is seen [16]. It was hypothesized that so called creeping fat is a potent source of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other paracrine mediators, as well as it plays a significant role in the immune response to commensal bacteria [17]. In this hypothesis, further transmural inflammatory lesions are a consequence of an unusual transformation of mesenteric fatty tissue, as it was suggested that creeping fat in CD seen in MRE, has several features different from tissue seen in other gastrointestinal diseases, showing more inflammatory and fibrous pattern [18, 19].

According to these data, we observed that a significant influence of anti-TNF antibodies, seen in all study groups (short-term and long-term responders, as well as among primary non-responders), concerned only the mesenteric fatty tissue. Thus, one could hypothesize that the primary site of action of anti-TNF antibodies is the mesenteric creeping fat. Hypothetically, the decrease in the CD activity seen in MRE in terms of the mesenteric fatty tissue in the primary non-responders group could be an evidence, that anti-TNF antibodies started to act, but some poorly defined factors did not allow them to lead to further transmural and extraintestinal healing.

Our study has several limitations. In our opinion, the most important one is the retrospective nature of the analysis. However, as all MRE studies were blinded for the radiologist and then randomly analysed, we believe that this methodological fact reduces the risk of statistical bias. Another possible limitation is the use of concomitant medicines. Although the doses of immunosuppressive drugs were stable during the whole observation, tapering of steroids after finishing the induction phase of anti-TNF therapy or discontinuation of antibiotics were allowed in our study. It could be hypothesized that these facts can bias the interpretation of the direct influence of anti-TNF agents on CD inflammatory activity in MRE. However, in our real-life study group, we could not exclude those patients, as tapering of steroids or discontinuation of antibiotics is a consequence of successful application of anti-TNF antibodies. Moreover, steroids and antibiotics should not be used for a longer period of time. There are also no data regarding the intestinal healing effect of steroids or antibiotics in CD. This phenomenon has been shown only for anti-TNF agents and, to a lesser extent, for immunosuppressive drugs [9]. Thus, we hypothesize that the fact of tapering the steroids or discontinuing the antibiotics in our study group had limited or even had no influence on intestinal healing seen in MRE, and the observed phenomena in imaging studies are only related to application of anti-TNF antibodies.

Another possible limitation is the used SEAS-CD scoring system, as it assesses MRE features more on a global level and not on a bowel segment level, as it is done with the MaRIA system [12, 13]. This could be hypothetically problematic in patients in whom one intestinal segment responds to the therapy and other does not; however, such a situation is not likely to occur. Nevertheless, SEAS-CD takes into account the length of inflamed bowel loop, which is quantified and scored separately. Moreover, SEAS-CD scoring system assesses the CD activity (together with quantification of its extent) separately in the jejunum and ileum. That is why, although SEAS-CD does not allow for segmental assessment similar to MaRIA, it takes into account the different CD locations throughout the gastrointestinal tract and its extent in the bowel loops. Thus, it can be even reliable in the hypothetical aforementioned situation of simultaneous response and non-response to anti-TNF therapy in different bowel segments in the same patient.

To conclude, in our study, we showed that MRE is a useful tool in the assessment of CD course in patients treated with anti-TNF agents. We confirmed that transmural and extraintestinal healing occurs only in individuals responding to the therapy, although, the reduction of the inflammatory lesions seen in MRE takes place to some extent also in the non-responders. The most important compounds of the transmural and extraintestinal healing phenomenon seem to be the bowel wall thickening, mesenteric lymphadenopathy and wrapping of the mesenteric fatty tissue with the vascular proliferation. Data from our study cannot indicate the possible primary site of action of anti-TNF antibodies leading to intestinal healing, although the importance of mesenteric fatty tissue is discussed. There are too few proofs of the crucial role of creeping fat in the efficacy of biological therapy. We hypothesize, however, that our data could be an interesting background for further analyses on the role of mesenteric fatty tissue in anti-TNF therapy of CD.

Each is a single continuous space with interconnected regions. Disease can spread either within the subperitoneal space or within the peritoneal cavity to distant sites in the abdomen and pelvis via these interconnecting pathways. Disease can also cross the peritoneum to spread from the subperitoneal space to the peritoneal cavity or vice versa.

The article is based on the comprehensive and authoritative book by Drs Meyers, Charnsangavej, and Oliphant titled Meyers’ Dynamic Radiology of the Abdomen [1]. Key concepts from the book are highlighted in the following text and in Table 1. The text and accompanying illustrative images are divided into 3 sections on anatomy, an overview of the spread of disease, and disease spread for selected organs.Table 1 Key concepts regarding the peritoneal cavity and subperitoneal space (SPS)

Concept	Discussion	
Spaces of the abdomen and pelvis	There are 2 mutually exclusive spaces—the peritoneal cavity and the SPS	
The structure that defines the SPS & separates it from the peritoneal cavity	The peritoneum	
The peritoneal cavity	The peritoneal cavity is a potential space and is inconspicuous on normal imaging studies. There are no organs in the peritoneal cavity.	
The SPS	The SPS is a single extraperitoneal space encompassing the entire abdomen and pelvis. It is divided into regions but remains one interconnected space. The SPS contains all the organs, vessels, lymphatics, and nerves of the abdomen and pelvis.	
The importance of distinguishing the SPS from the peritoneal cavity	The routes of disease spread differ for the SPS and the peritoneal cavity	
The distinct patterns of disease spread in the SPS	Disease spread can occur via mesenteries, ligaments, and lymphatics, and by periarterial, perineural, transvenous, and intratubular routes	
The distinct patterns of disease spread within the peritoneal cavity	Disease spreads along the pathways of fluid flow in the single continuous space of the peritoneal cavity	
Transperitoneal disease spread	Transperitoneal spread occurs when disease crosses the peritoneum which separates the SPS from the peritoneal cavity. Transperitoneal spread is bidirectional	


Anatomy
Lack of organs in the peritoneal cavity
The peritoneum is a serous membrane made up of visceral and parietal layers. The visceral layer of the peritoneum lines the surface of organs and the parietal peritoneum lines the coelomic cavity. The peritoneal cavity is a potential space between the visceral and parietal layers of the peritoneum. There are no organs in the peritoneal cavity. The potential space of the peritoneal cavity is normally not visible on imaging as it contains only a small amount of fluid (about 100 mL). The peritoneum is analogous to the pleura which has a visceral layer covering lung and a parietal layer lining the thoracic cavity. Similar to the pleural cavity, the peritoneal cavity is visualized on imaging if it is abnormally distended by fluid, gas, or masses.

Location of the abdominal and pelvic organs
There are two spaces in the abdomen and pelvis, the peritoneal cavity (a potential space) and the subperitoneal space, and these are separated by the peritoneum (Fig. 1). Regardless of the complexity of development in the embryo, the subperitoneal space and the peritoneal cavity remain separated from each other, and each remains a single continuous space (Figs. 2A, 3A). Distinguishing the subperitoneal space from the potential space of the peritoneal cavity is important for understanding the distinct patterns of disease spread in each.Fig. 1 The peritoneal cavity vs the subperitoneal space. This is a schematic diagram showing the peritoneal cavity (PC) on the left and the subperitoneal space (SPS) on the right. The diagram illustrates that these are 2 completely separate spaces within the abdominal cavity. The peritoneal cavity and the subperitoneal space are separated by the peritoneum. The peritoneal cavity is one continuous space with interconnecting recesses, some of which are shown. The subperitoneal space is also one continuous space containing all the abdominal pelvic organs which are interconnected via ligaments and mesenteries. Dotted lines show some of these interconnections which allow for disease spread. Abbreviations for the peritoneal cavity: IC inframesocolic compartment, LP left paracolic recess, LS lesser sac, M Morison’s pouch, RP right paracolic recess, RS right subphrenic space, and RV rectovesical space. Abbreviations for the subperitoneal space: B bladder, C colon, K kidney, L liver, P pancreas, S spleen, SB small bowel, and ST stomach.

The medial visceral layer (arrows) of the peritoneum is apposed on the gut and the mesentery, while the parietal layer is lateral. The dorsal mesentery (DM) conveys vessels from the aorta to the gut. Other than the peritoneal cavity, all the tissue in the abdominal cavity portion of the diagram is the subperitoneal space (light gray shaded area). Spine is shown on the diagram only for orientation purposes. A aorta, K kidney, S spine, and VM ventral mesentery. B Axial CT image shows the dorsal mesentery of the small bowel as subperitoneal tissue (arrowhead) between 2 layers of visceral peritoneum (black arrows). The parietal peritoneal reflection (white arrows) is also seen anterior to the colon (C), kidney, and in the anterior and lateral abdomen. There is fluid (asterisk) in the peritoneal cavity between the visceral (black arrows) and parietal (white arrows) layers of the peritoneum.

The term subperitoneal refers to tissue that is deep to the peritoneum and includes the extraperitoneal space, the ligaments and the mesenteries and their suspended organs (Fig. 2A). Organs whose surfaces are covered by peritoneum are therefore subperitoneal. Subperitoneal organs that are deep to the posterior peritoneum are called extraperitoneal. Since there are only 2 spaces in the abdomen and there are no organs in the peritoneal cavity, all the abdominal pelvic organs, and their associated vessels, lymphatics, and nerves are in the subperitoneal space. In other words, all the structures seen in the abdomen and pelvis on cross-sectional imaging are in the subperitoneal space. The organs lie in the abdominal cavity, not the peritoneal cavity (Figs. 1, 2A). The peritoneal cavity is a potential space devoid of organs.

Importance of visualizing the subperitoneal space as a single space
The subperitoneal space is a large continuous space that is formed by regions interconnected by ligaments and mesenteries. Ligaments and mesenteries refer to the subperitoneal tissue between suspended organs and the extraperitoneal space. Visualizing the subperitoneal space as a single space explains the spread of disease between different regions of the abdomen pelvis and between the organs covered by peritoneum and the extraperitoneum.

The relationship between the bowel mesentery and the peritoneum
The mesenteries of the abdomen and pelvis are composed of subperitoneal tissue between 2 layers of visceral peritoneum. Comparing an axial CT image with a cross-sectional diagram of an embryo, the dorsal mesentery carries vessels from the aorta to the gut (Fig. 2). The visceral peritoneum surrounds the mesentery, forms the serosal layer of the gut, and is in continuity with the parietal peritoneum which covers the extraperitoneal space. As the ligaments, mesenteries, and suspended organs develop, the peritoneal cavity forms recesses that remain interconnected as the peritoneal cavity and separate from the subperitoneal space (Fig. 3A).

Correlation between embryonic development and the abdominal ligaments
The spleen, pancreas, liver, and gut form within the mesentery that surrounds and suspends the primitive gut in the embryo. The development of these organs results in the creation of the abdominal ligaments that can be identified on CT.

Posteriorly, the spleen and pancreas form in the dorsal mesogastrium, or the part of the dorsal mesentery suspending the stomach (Fig. 3). The splenic artery runs from the aorta through the dorsal mesogastrium to the spleen with branches continuing to the stomach. The part of the dorsal mesogastrium between the stomach and the spleen becomes the gastrosplenic ligament containing the short gastric vessels. The part of the dorsal mesogastrium containing the pancreas fuses with the subperitoneal tissues anterior to the kidney leaving a connecting splenorenal ligament that contains the distal splenic artery and vein. The midgut and hindgut form within the dorsal mesentery creating the small intestine mesentery and the mesocolon.

Anteriorly, the liver forms in the subperitoneal tissues anterior to the stomach, or the ventral mesogastrium. This divides the subperitoneal tissues into the gastrohepatic ligament between the stomach and liver, and the falciform ligament between the liver and abdominal wall. The free edge of the gastrohepatic ligament is the hepatoduodenal ligament. The visceral peritoneum continues over the stomach forming the serosal layer and over the liver and spleen forming their capsules.

Identifying the ligaments and bowel mesenteries on imaging
The ligaments and mesenteries are named according to the viscera they connect and are identified by the vessels that run in them. For example, the hepatoduodenal ligament is identified by the portal vein, hepatic artery, and common bile duct. Selected ligaments and their associated vessels are described in Table 2. The ligaments and mesenteries are a pathway for disease spread between organs. The vasculature within the mesenteries often acts as a scaffold for disease spread. The utility of identifying the mesenteries and ligaments is to more accurately and efficiently recognize sites of disease spread.Table 2 Selected abdominal and pelvic ligaments and mesenteries

Anatomic continuity between the pararenal spaces
The posterior portion of the extraperitoneal space, the retroperitoneum, in the abdomen is divided by the renal fascia into the anterior pararenal, perinephric, and posterior pararenal spaces (Fig. 4). The anterior pararenal space is between the parietal peritoneum and the anterior renal fascia; the perinephric space is between the anterior and posterior renal fascia; the posterior pararenal space is between the posterior renal fascia and the transversalis fascia. The posterior renal fascia has 2 layers. An anterior layer that is continuous with the anterior renal fascia and a posterior layer that forms the lateroconal fascia which in turn goes anterolaterally to blend with the peritoneum.Fig. 4 Renal fasciae. A Axial CT image shows the anterior and posterior renal fascia (black arrows). Arrowheads show the posterior pararenal space extending laterally as the properitoneal fat. B Axial CT image shows fluid (arrows) in between the 2 layers of the posterior renal fascia. Fluid from the anterior pararenal space can extend into this potential space between the 2 layers. Arrowhead points to the lower pole of the kidney.



Laterally at the level of the kidney, the lateroconal fascia separates the anterior pararenal space from the posterior pararenal space. Below the level of the kidney and the iliac crest, the anterior and posterior renal fasciae tend to fuse resulting in anatomic continuity between the anterior and posterior pararenal spaces continuing inferiorly as the infrarenal space.

The anterior pararenal space contains the pancreas, duodenum, and ascending and descending colon. The perinephric space contains the kidney and adrenal gland. The posterior pararenal space has no organs and is continuous laterally with the extraperitoneal fat of the properitoneal flank stripe.

Compartmentalization of the pelvic subperitoneal tissues
Anteriorly, the umbilicovesical fascia encloses the bladder and urachus in the perivesical space (Fig. 5). The umbilicovesical fascia also defines the prevesical space anteriorly and laterally. Posteriorly, the rectum is in the perirectal space which is defined laterally by the perirectal fascia, posteriorly by the posterior pelvic fascia, and anteriorly by the rectovesical fascia in the male and the rectovaginal fascia in the female. The aggregate of these fasciae is also referred to as the mesorectal fascia. Superiorly, the perirectal space communicates with the sigmoid mesocolon. The presacral space is posterior to the perirectal space.Fig. 5 Pelvic spaces. A axial CT image of the pelvis. The urachus (arrowhead) and obliterated umbilical arteries (arrows) form the median umbilical ligament and the medial umbilical folds, respectively, and are encased within the umbilicovesical fascia forming the perivesical space. The prevesical space is anterior and lateral to the bladder. The perirectal space (asterisk) surrounds the rectum. B Sagittal CT image shows the peritoneum (arrows) along the anterior abdominal wall and reflecting over the bladder and rectum. Peritoneal fluid in the inframesocolic compartment (IM) communicates with the rectovesical recess (asterisk). The bladder is inferiorly displaced by the peritoneal fluid. B bladder, R rectum.



The peritoneum reflects over the dome of the bladder, the uterine body, and the rectouterine recess (Fig. 5). Laterally, in the female, the peritoneum forms the folds of the broad ligament. In the female, the broad ligament suspends the female pelvic organs and is in continuity with the extraperitoneal space. Regions within the broad ligament form the mesometrium, mesosalpinx, and the mesovarium. These mesenteries are all in continuity within the broad ligament. The serosa of the fallopian tube is continuous as part of the broad ligament and its fimbriated end is open to the peritoneal cavity. The ovary lies within the broad ligament immediately beneath the peritoneum. The arteries, veins, lymphatics, and nerves to the female pelvic organs all course within the broad ligament and connect with the extraperitoneal space. This forms the pathways for the subperitoneal spread of disease.

Overview of disease spread
The pathways of disease spread in the abdominal cavity
Since all organs are subperitoneal, the subperitoneal space is a natural pathway for disease spread (Fig. 6). Potential routes are along the mesenteries and ligaments, via visceral lymphatics to nodes, and by periarterial, perineural, or transvenous routes as well as along ducts. Continuity of the subperitoneal space explains the spread of disease from one organ to another. Disease can spread bidirectionally within the subperitoneal space using the pathways created by normal structures. If a tumor is present, tracing the organ’s blood supply helps identify nodes that are potential pathways for spread. If an abnormal node is discovered, knowing its location helps in the search for the primary site.Fig. 6 Diagram shows the 2 routes of disease spread for viscera which are covered by peritoneum–transperitoneal and subperitoneal. Disease can cross the visceral peritoneum (solid arrow) to enter and subsequently spread in the peritoneal cavity. Alternatively, disease can follow the vessels and lymphatics (open arrow) of the viscera to spread in the subperitoneal space (SPS).



For organs which are covered by peritoneum, there is an additional pathway for spread (Fig. 6). Transperitoneal spread occurs when disease traverses the visceral peritoneum along the surface of the organ. This route is possible because the peritoneum consists of a single layer of mesothelial cells on a bed of loose connective tissue [2]. Neoplastic and inflammatory cells, gas, and hemorrhage in the subperitoneal space can therefore cross the peritoneum to enter the peritoneal cavity. Subsequently, peritoneal spread occurs via the circulating peritoneal fluid to the peritoneal recesses in the abdomen and pelvis.

In summary, the pathways of disease spread are subperitoneal and peritoneal. In addition, transperitoneal spread occurs when subperitoneal disease crosses the peritoneal lining and spreads within the peritoneal cavity.

Omental tumor: subperitoneal disease or peritoneal carcinomatosis
The surface of the greater omentum is lined by visceral peritoneum and the internal composition is of subperitoneal fat, lymphatics, and vessels. Communicating channels allow fluid in the peritoneal cavity to be absorbed by the omental lymphatics. Thus, tumor cells that are in the peritoneal cavity being disseminated by the peritoneal route can traverse the visceral peritoneum to grow in the richly vascular subperitoneal tissues of the omentum. In addition to the omentum, common sites of peritoneal tumor implants are the diaphragm and the dependent peritoneal recesses.

Peritoneal fluid flow in the abdomen and pelvis
The transverse mesocolon divides the peritoneal cavity into the supramesocolic and inframesocolic compartments. The latter is divided into right and left infracolic recesses by the root of the small bowel mesentery. Peritoneal fluid is drawn into the upper abdomen by low subdiaphragmatic pressures and is pulled into the pelvis under the influence of gravity. Fluid travels from the pelvis to the abdomen via the paracolic gutters and travels from the abdominal infracolic compartment to the pelvis (Fig. 7). It pools in dependent recesses, the most prominent of which are the pouch of Douglas in the female and the rectovesical recess in the male, along the superior portion of the sigmoid mesocolon, ileocolic region, right paracolic gutter, and Morison’s pouch.Fig. 7 Peritoneal cavity fluid flow and recesses. A coronal CT image shows peritoneal carcinomatosis demonstrating the peritoneal recesses. Tumor in the right subdiaphragmatic recess (black arrow) and Morison’s pouch (double black arrows). Tumor (arrowheads) is also seen along the peritoneal reflection over the bladder (B). White arrows show continuity between the paravesical and paracolic recesses. B Axial CT image in a different patient shows the epiploic foramen (arrow) between the portal vein and inferior vena cava and fluid in the lesser sac (asterisk). C coronal CT image in a different patient shows fluid in the superior recess of the lesser sac (SR) and in the gastrohepatic recess (black arrow) separated by the gastrohepatic ligament (black arrowheads). Fluid in the gastrohepatic recess communicates with fluid in the left subphrenic space (LS). D coronal CT image in a different patient shows fluid in the lesser sac (asterisk) and in the gastrosplenic recess (GS) separated by the gastrosplenic ligament (arrow). There is continuity between the gastrosplenic and left subphrenic (LS) recesses.



All the peritoneal recesses communicate, however, peritoneal fluid preferentially flows in certain directions and is anatomically limited in some locations. Peritoneal fluid from the pelvis primarily goes up the right paracolic gutter (recess) forming continuity of the inframesocolic and supramesocolic recesses on the right. On the left, the phrenicocolic ligament limits the left paracolic gutter (recess) to the inframesocolic recess. From the right paracolic gutter, fluid enters the right subhepatic space (Morison’s pouch) and may subsequently enter the lesser sac via the epiploic foramen (of Winslow) between the main portal vein and the inferior vena cava (Fig. 7). Fluid also goes superiorly into the right subphrenic space but the falciform ligament limits flow from the right to the left subphrenic space. Abscesses secondary to intraperitoneal infections are therefore common in the pouch of Douglas, right paracolic gutter, right subhepatic space, and right subphrenic space. Fluid flow patterns are mostly bidirectional.

Although the falciform and phrenicocolic ligaments typically limit fluid flow across them, large volumes of fluid can overflow under the free edge of the falciform ligament and over the phrenicocolic ligament. Left subphrenic fluid is more commonly seen due to gastric, splenic, or splenic flexure colonic pathology. There is continuity between the left subphrenic space, the gastrohepatic space, and the perisplenic spaces such as the gastrosplenic recess and splenorenal recess. These are separated from the lesser sac by the gastrohepatic, gastrosplenic, and splenorenal ligaments, respectively.

Distinguishing intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal fluid in the pelvis
Intraperitoneal pelvic fluid (ascites) occurs in the pouch of Douglas and in the lateral recesses which lie on either side of the sigmoid colon and are referred to as paravesical recesses of the peritoneal cavity (Fig. 8). Extraperitoneal pelvic fluid in the subperitoneal space occurs in the prevesical space which is anterior and lateral to the bladder. Since the bladder is positioned more inferiorly in the pelvis than the sigmoid colon, ascites is seen superior to the bladder. Ascites displaces the bladder inferiorly, while prevesical space fluid displaces the bladder posteromedial. Extraperitoneal fluid in the prevesical space extends bilaterally forming a symmetric or asymmetric “molar tooth” appearance of fluid both anterior and lateral to the bladder (Fig. 8).Fig. 8 Pelvic intraperitoneal fluid vs extraperitoneal fluid. Pelvic fluid is shown in 2 different patients. The patient in A has intraperitoneal fluid. The patient in B and C has extraperitoneal fluid. A axial CT image shows intraperitoneal fluid in the right and left paravesical recesses (asterisks) lateral to the sigmoid colon (S) and superior to the bladder (not shown). B Axial CT image of a different patient shows extraperitoneal fluid in the prevesical space (asterisk) anterior to the decompressed bladder (arrowhead) containing a catheter. The bladder is displaced posteriorly. Fluid extends within the prevesical space (arrows) lateral to the bladder giving a “molar tooth” appearance. C sagittal CT image in the same patient as in B shows extraperitoneal fluid in the prevesical space (asterisk) anterior to the posteriorly displaced bladder (arrows) containing a catheter.



Ascites preserves the properitoneal fat which is the lateral extension of the posterior pararenal space and outlines the medial umbilical folds anteromedial. Extraperitoneal fluid in the prevesical space can extend to the lower abdomen and obliterate the properitoneal fat. The anterior extension spares the midline triangle of the perivesical fat that encases the urachus (median umbilical ligament) and the obliterated umbilical arteries (medial umbilical ligament). If prevesical fluid penetrates the overlying transversalis fascia, it can involve the rectus muscle. Conversely, rectus hematomas can extend into the prevesical fat.

Ascites travels superiorly from the lateral paravesical peritoneal recesses to the paracolic gutters. Prevesical fluid travels superiorly into the infrarenal space and subsequently into the pararenal spaces. Posteriorly, extraperitoneal fluid extends into the presacral space. Ascites can go into the inguinal canal along a hernia, while prevesical fluid can go to the inguinal ring along the vas deferens. Unlike ascites, prevesical fluid abuts the lateral pelvic musculature and can extend along the external iliac vessels and femoral sheath.

Distinguishing intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal free air in the abdomen
The shape of the subdiaphragmatic air and change with respiration and position help distinguish intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal free air. On an upright chest radiograph, free intraperitoneal air follows the contour of the dome of the hemidiaphragm, while extraperitoneal air is usually medial or lateral to the apex of the hemidiaphragm. The volume of free intraperitoneal air seen under the hemidiaphragm increases on inspiration due to decreased subdiaphragmatic pressure. The volume of free extraperitoneal air seen under the hemidiaphragm increases on expiration due to decreased compression by the diaphragm. Free intraperitoneal air fills the potential recesses of the peritoneal cavity and can outline ligaments such as the falciform ligament. Free extraperitoneal air can occupy extraperitoneal spaces and can outline the psoas muscle and follow the flank stripe if within the posterior pararenal space. Peritoneal air shifts readily with position change, while extraperitoneal air does not.

Potential routes of spread of extraperitoneal free air
Extraperitoneal free air originating anywhere in the abdomen can spread throughout the abdomen and pelvis via the interconnecting subperitoneal space.

Air from a duodenal perforation can go from the anterior pararenal space to the infrarenal space and then to the posterior pararenal space or to the prevesical space of the pelvis.

Extraperitoneal pelvic free air from a rectal perforation can go from the mesorectum to the sigmoid mesocolon to the prevesical space. From the prevesical space air can go inferiorly along the vas deferens to the scrotum, laterally outside the pelvic cavity via the sciatic foramen and into the thighs along the scaffold of the femoral sheath. From the prevesical space air can also go superiorly into the infrarenal space and then to the posterior pararenal space or to the anterior pararenal space. Extraperitoneal air in the posterior pararenal space can extend laterally within the properitoneal fat and superiorly to the level of the respiratory diaphragm (Fig. 9). In the anterior pararenal space air can surround the pancreas and extend to the porta hepatis, to the bare areas of the liver and spleen, and to the root of the mesenteries of the small bowel and transverse colon. Continuity within the anterior pararenal space allows for bidirectional spread between the organs of the extraperitoneum and suspended organs via their mesenteries all within the subperitoneal space.Fig. 9 Extraperitoneal free air. Sagittal CT image shows pneumatosis of the ascending colon and extraluminal air in the adjacent mesentery (asterisk). This extraperitoneal free air tracks in the anterior and posterior pararenal spaces (arrows) to the bare area of the liver and diaphragm (arrowheads).



Extraperitoneal air can also track along the aorta and into the chest through the aortic hiatus. Extraperitoneal air in the gastrohepatic ligament can enter the chest through the esophageal hiatus. This spread is bidirectional and air from the mediastinum can spread throughout the abdomen within the subperitoneal space.

Disease spread for selected organs
Potential routes of spread of pancreatic disease
The spread of pancreatic disease highlights the concept of the subperitoneal space as a single space (Fig. 10). The pancreas lies in the anterior pararenal space. This space is a natural pathway as it connects with the base of several mesenteries. The tail of the pancreas lies in the splenic hilum so disease can spread along the gastrosplenic ligament to the gastrocolic ligament along the greater curvature of the stomach. The head of the pancreas is connected to the hepatic hilum by the hepatoduodenal ligament so disease can spread along the gastrohepatic ligament to the lesser curvature of the stomach. The root of the transverse mesocolon lies along the pancreas so disease can spread to the transverse colon. Similarly, the root of the small bowel mesentery starts adjacent to the anterior inferior aspect of the pancreatic body so disease can spread to the ileocolic region.Fig. 10 Subperitoneal spread of disease. A Axial CT image shows a large pancreatic mass (white arrow) extending along the hepatoduodenal ligament to the porta hepatis (arrowheads). Mass also invades the left perinephric space and engulfs the adrenal gland (black arrow). Superiorly, the mass extended into the gastrohepatic ligament with invasion of the left lobe of the liver (not shown). B Coronal CT image shows a hematoma in the root of the small bowel mesentery extending toward the ileocecal junction within the small intestine mesentery (arrows). C Coronal CT image shows a heterogeneous mass (white arrows) around the inferior vena cava and aorta. Mass extends superiorly, through the aortic hiatus, to the posterior mediastinum (black arrowheads). The mass also extended into the root of the small bowel mesentery (not shown) along the superior mesenteric artery.



The peritoneum forming the posterior margin of the lesser sac is anterior to  the pancreas. Disease can cross the peritoneum (transperitoneal spread) to enter the lesser sac for subsequent peritoneal spread.

Anatomic basis for a hepatic laceration resulting in a retroperitoneal hematoma
The bare area of the liver is that part of the posterior right lobe of the liver that is not covered by peritoneum (Fig. 11). The peritoneum covering the liver reflects on itself to form the right coronary ligament and attach the right lobe to the right hemidiaphragm. The liver posterior and medial to this reflection is left bare of peritoneum and abuts the diaphragm. In addition, the parietal peritoneum of the inferior right coronary ligament also fuses with the anterior renal fascia. Posteriorly, the diaphragmatic fascia fuses with the right posterior renal fascia. As a result, the space between the anterior and posterior renal fascia, or the right perinephric space, communicates with the bare area of the liver. Hemorrhage from the hepatic bare area can therefore present as a retroperitoneal bleed in the right perinephric space. Similarly, a right perinephric abscess can directly spread to the liver and diaphragm.Fig. 11 Extraperitoneal spaces in the upper abdomen. A Sagittal CT image shows the peritoneal reflections over the liver (arrows). The liver posterior and medial to these reflections is left bare of peritoneum and abuts the diaphragm (arrowhead). Note that peritoneal fluid surrounds the liver except for the bare area. B Sagittal CT image shows fluid in the left perinephric space (asterisk) extending superiorly to abut the diaphragm (white arrow). The fluid is posterior to the pancreas (P) and the splenorenal ligament (black arrow).



On the left, the perinephric space communicates with the left subphrenic extraperitoneal space (Fig. 11) [2]. This is the result of the left anterior renal fascia fusing with the gastrosplenic ligament and the posterior renal fascia fusing with the diaphragm [2]. In addition, the peritoneum covers most of the spleen except for the splenic hilum. The splenorenal ligament connects the bare area of the spleen at the hilum with the left anterior pararenal space. Bleeding from a ruptured splenic artery aneurysm can therefore result in a retroperitoneal bleed in the anterior pararenal space.

Anatomic basis for a hepatobiliary tumor mimicking a pancreatic mass
Tumor from the liver and gallbladder can spread to the nodes within the hepatoduodenal ligament. The anterior periportal nodes follow the lymphatics along the hepatic artery to the celiac artery and then to the cisterna chyli. The posterior periportal nodes follow the lymphatics to the retropancreatic nodes, aortocaval node, and then to the cisterna chyli. Therefore, an enlarged retropancreatic node from a metastatic hepatobiliary tumor can mimic a pancreatic mass. Other routes of nodal spread are the gastrohepatic ligament or adjacent to the suprahepatic inferior vena cava to the juxtaphrenic and paraesophageal nodes.

Diaphragmatic adenopathy secondary to peritoneal carcinomatosis
Similar to the omentum, the diaphragm has abundant lymphatics for the absorption of peritoneal fluid. This process can result in tumor cells being transported from the peritoneal cavity to the diaphragmatic nodes. Metastatic diaphragmatic adenopathy can therefore occur secondary to peritoneal carcinomatosis from abdominal and pelvic malignancies.

Potential routes of peritoneal spread of blood following trauma
Traumatic injuries of viscera can disrupt the capsule of an organ. The visceral peritoneum forms the capsule of the liver and spleen, except for the bare areas described earlier. Therefore, a laceration allows for transperitoneal spread of blood from these organs into the peritoneal cavity. Following a laceration of the peritonealized surface of the liver, blood can spread into the right subphrenic space and right subhepatic space and can subsequently enter the lesser sac and right paracolic gutter. Following a laceration of the peritonealized surface of the spleen, blood can enter the perisplenic space, left subphrenic space, and gastrohepatic space. Larger volumes can also spread to the left paracolic gutter. From the paracolic gutters, blood can accumulate in the dependent rectovesical recess of the pelvis.

Since the peritoneum forms the serosa of bowel, bowel perforations can result in blood, air and bowel contents such as endoluminal contrast spilling into the peritoneal cavity. The mesenteric vessels lie in subperitoneal fat between 2 layers of visceral peritoneum. Blood from a mesenteric hematoma can therefore traverse the visceral peritoneum to enter the peritoneal cavity and appear as intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Similarly, hemorrhage in tissues around extraperitoneal organs such as the pancreas and kidney can cross the posterior peritoneum to enter the peritoneal cavity.

In the pelvis, the peritoneum reflects over the bladder dome. A rupture of the bladder dome results in intraperitoneal spill of urine and administered bladder contrast into the paravesical, paracolic, and inframesocolic recesses. Intraperitoneal bladder rupture is less common than extraperitoneal bladder rupture.

At any site in the abdomen and pelvis, once blood, air, or contrast has entered the peritoneal cavity, it can travel to any of the peritoneal recesses.

Summary
The two spaces of the abdomen are separated by the peritoneum (Table 1).

The peritoneal cavity is a potential space between the visceral and parietal layers of the peritoneum. This potential space normally contains only a small amount of peritoneal fluid and is not seen on transaxial imaging of normal patients. The peritoneal cavity is distinct from the subperitoneal space and contains no organs or structures. The spread pattern in the peritoneal cavity follows the flow of peritoneal fluid.

The subperitoneal space is a continuous interconnecting space beneath the peritoneum containing the extraperitoneal space, the ligaments and mesenteries, and their suspended organs. Individual mesenteries and ligaments are identified by the vessels that course through them. The subperitoneal space provides the avenues for bidirectional spread of disease.

Transperitoneal spread occurs when disease spreads from the subperitoneal space to the peritoneal cavity by crossing the peritoneal lining.

Methods: The authors used Medicare claims data, fee schedules, established protocols, and other sources to estimate CTC and OC per-screen costs, including the costs of OC referrals for a subset of CTC patients. They then modeled and compared the Medicare costs of patients who complied with CTC and OC screening recommendations and tested alternative scenarios. Results: CTC is 29% less expensive than OC for the Medicare population in the base scenario. Although the CTC cost advantage is increased or reduced under alternative scenarios, it is always positive. Conclusion: CTC is a cost-effective CRC screening option for the Medicare population and will likely reduce Medicare expenditures for CRC screening.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is reevaluating the evidence for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, including the efficacy of CT colonography (CTC) [1]. The USPSTF will assign a grade of A or B to CTC screening if they find sufficient evidence to substantiate CTC screening which provides a net population health benefit [2]. Based on currently available data, some experts believe that the USPSTF will give an A or B grade to CTC screening [3, 4], which would require private health insurance plans to cover CTC screening [5]. Medicaid plans would also be required to cover CTC screening for Affordable Care Act “expansion adult” enrollees [6] and for all enrollees if the state has an extra federal match for USPSTF preventative services [7]. While Medicare often follows USPSTF’s lead, Medicare is not required to cover USPSTF A and B services and may make its own coverage decision [8].

Medicare policy has been guided by the “triple aim” since 2010 [9]. The triple aims are toImprove the patient experience of care (including quality and satisfaction),

Improve the health of populations, and

Reduce the per capita cost of health care [10].



Providing Medicare enrollees access to CTC for CRC screening should improve patient adherence to American Cancer Society (ACS) CRC screening guidelines and patient satisfaction [3, 11, 12]. CTC offers distinct advantages for Medicare enrollees compared to optical colonoscopy (OC or simply “colonoscopy”): CTC is less invasive, has fewer complications, and needs no anesthesia. No anesthesia avoids the need for an escort for the patient post-procedure. Medicare coverage of CTC is therefore consistent with the first two goals of the triple aim.

This paper addresses cost, the third goal of the triple aim. Officially, Medicare does not consider cost in its coverage determinations. However, the prominence of the triple aim, the push toward “value-based care” [13], budgetary stress, and analysis of recent coverage decisions have led some to conclude that cost is likely a factor in Medicare coverage decisions [14]. Furthermore, private Medicare Advantage plans now cover over 30% of Medicare enrollees [15], and they are permitted to cover services not covered by Medicare [16]. Cost is critically important for private payer plans.

The last published evaluation of the relative cost of CTC to OC for Medicare was prepared in 2009 using Medicare OC fees from 2007 [17]. With substantial changes in reimbursement and clinical practices in recent years and additional evidence demonstrating similar efficacy of CTC and OC, this paper fills an important gap.

Methods
We estimated the per-screen costs of OC and CTC, the frequency of colonic and extra-colonic screening findings and the resulting rescreen times, the size and demographic mix of the Medicare population, and built a simulation model to produce Medicare population-level cost comparisons of the two screening methods. In addition, we tested several alternative scenarios. Throughout this paper, “costs” refers to Medicare allowed amounts, which include the Medicare payment and the enrollee cost sharing payment. For bowel preparation agents, the allowed amounts are those administered by the Medicare Part D insurer.

OC per-screen costs
We used the 2013 Medicare 5% Sample of Medicare Part A and Part B enrollment and claims as our primary data source for OC costs [18]. We adjusted the claim costs for changes in Medicare fee schedules between 2013 and 2015 and, because the 5% Sample does not contain prescription drug data, separately developed costs for bowel preparation agents. To include all colonoscopy-related costs, we collected all costs for the day of a colonoscopy (a “colonoscopy day”) and excluded the costs clearly not related to the colonoscopy. We separately quantified the cost of colonoscopies with and without biopsies.

We limited the OC cost analysis to Medicare enrollees with Medicare Part A and Part B coverage. We excluded Medicare Advantage and other capitated enrollees as claims are unreliable [19]. We identified an enrollee as having a colonoscopy day by the presence of a non-inpatient professional or technical claim with an allowed charge greater than $0 and a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code or Current Procedural Terminology (CPT®) code for a colonoscopy (Table 1).Table 1 Colonoscopy codes

aCode is used only by Medicare, specifically for screening colonoscopies


bIf accompanied by an ICD-9-CM diagnosis code of V7651 (screen for malignant neoplasm-colon), a procedure modifier code of PT (colorectal cancer screening test, converted to a diagnostic test or other procedure), or a procedure modifier code of 33 (preventative service)


cA separate same-day claim for CPT code 88305 (Level IV—Surgical pathology—colon biopsy, Lymph node biopsy, Colorectal Polyp) indicates a biopsy



Most colonoscopies have both professional and technical claims. We classified the colonoscopy day as screening if we found either a professional and/or a technical claim with a HCPCS code indicating screening, a diagnostic colonoscopy CPT code accompanied by a diagnosis code indicating screening, or a procedure modifier code indicating either a screening or a preventive service. We excluded colonoscopy days with procedure modifiers indicating reduced services or an incomplete procedure (less than 2% of colonoscopy days). See Table 1.

We classified a colonoscopy day as having a biopsy if there was a same-day professional and/or technical claim that indicated a biopsy, or we found one or more same-day colon biopsy pathology claims (Table 1). More than 95% of colonoscopies coded as a biopsy were accompanied by a pathology claim. We classified a colonoscopy day as having an anesthesia service if we identified a same-day professional outpatient anesthesia claim.

We excluded somewhat more than 10% of the screening colonoscopy days because they included both colonoscopies and upper endoscopies. We excluded colonoscopy days for patients under age 50 (less than 2%). Within a colonoscopy day, we excluded costs not directly relevant to screening colonoscopies, including inpatient services, emergency room services, prescription drugs, and durable medical equipment, totaling less than 2% of the total costs. A portion of these costs may be relevant to screening complications. We later tested for the potential cost impact of complications.

Colonoscopy bowel preparation costs (cathartic agents) are not covered under Medicare Part A or Part B but are covered under Medicare Part D. About 67% of Medicare beneficiaries with Parts A and B also have Part D. Separate, detailed Part D spending data were recently released [20]. Within the Part D data, we examined the cathartic agents prescribed by gastroenterologists and found the average cost for the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) recommended polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based preparations, such as MoviPrep and GaviLyte, and sodium phosphate-based preparations such as Suprep [21]. We note that some physicians recommend OTC cathartic agents that cost less than these agents and are not paid for by Medicare Part D [22].

In order to project the historical 2013 data to reflect 2015 cost levels, we calculated a weighted average 2013 to 2015 Medicare cost trend for the most frequent colonoscopy HCPCS (or CPT) codes, by site of service, using Medicare fee schedules. We applied the 2013 site of service distribution derived from colonoscopy claims identified in the Medicare 5% Sample, and estimated the per-unit colonoscopy costs for 2015.

CTC per-screen costs
Since Medicare currently does not have a fee for screening CTC, we used the current Medicare fee schedule for diagnostic CTC without intravenous (IV) contrast (CPT code 74261) for screening CTC. Since CTC requirements are similar for screening and non-contrast diagnostic purposes [23], we expect that Medicare reimbursement will be the same for a screening CTC as it is for a diagnostic CTC without IV contrast. Under Medicare’s fee system, the fee for diagnostic CTC has two components: professional and technical. The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) for the professional services applies across all sites of service. Technical service fees may be, however, site specific. While the technical component CTC fee for physician offices/clinics per the MPFS is substantially higher than for hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs), the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), Section 5102(b) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 limits payment for the technical component of imaging services to the lesser of the MPFS or the OPPS fees [24, 25]. Therefore, the 2015 national Medicare fee for diagnostic CTC is the same across settings (unlike colonoscopy).

Guidelines recommend that CTC bowel prep includes the use of cathartic and oral contrast tagging agents [23, 26, 27]. The recommended cathartic agents are the same as those for OC bowel preparation. Oral contrast tagging agents are included in the CTC fee, and no extra amounts for the tagging agents are billable to Medicare or the patient.

According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) and ACS Guidelines [23, 28], CTC patients with polyps 6+ mm should be offered follow-up OC with polypectomy. For patients with follow-up OC, we added the colonoscopy with biopsy fees to the CTC costs.

Screening findings, OC follow-up, and rescreen times
The size of the largest polyp is the most important finding for determining the CRC rescreen times and whether a CTC patient will have follow-up OC. The commonly reported size categories are 5 mm or smaller (diminutive), 6–9 mm (small), and 10 mm and larger (large). Other relevant characteristics for OC polyp findings include the total number of polyps, carcinoma status, adenoma status, hyperplasia status and grade, and other descriptors (hyperplastic, tubular, sessile, and serrated) [29]. The current OC standard of care, suggested by the ACS [30] and American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) [31] guidelines and encouraged by quality of care measures for adenoma detection rate and polypectomy rate [32, 33], is for physicians to remove all polyps, irrespective of size.

We combined the probability of large polyps reported by Lieberman [34] with the relative risk factor for small and diminutive polyps as reported by Lowenfels [35] to produce a table of polyp size findings by age and sex. The Lieberman and Lowenfels studies used data centered at approximately 2005. The literature suggests that colonoscopists are being asked to find and remove even diminutive polyps [32, 33, 36]. To account for increased polyp detection rates in recent years and Medicare’s demographics, we used Lieberman’s probability for large polyps, Lowenfels’ probability of small polyps relative to large polyps, and the results of our Medicare 5% Sample analysis for the probability of any polyp, with the probability of a diminutive polyp as the difference between the probability of any polyp and the sum of the probabilities of large and small polyps. See the Appendix in supplementary material for sample calculations.

We used the same large and small polyp detection rates for both OC and CTC. We ignored diminutive polyps potentially identified by CTC as they are not reported in isolation and do not impact rescreen time [23]. The literature indicates that CTC screenings may be either as sensitive or somewhat less sensitive as OC screenings for large and small polyp detection [37]. Assuming less sensitivity for CTC would lower CTC costs as fewer patients would be offered OC.

For OC, the consensus guidelines of the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer as published by the AGA Institute recommend rescreening of average risk individuals1 in 10 years if no polyps are found and, except for rare findings,2 between 3 and 10 years if polyps are found. Specific recommendations depend on the number of polyps and their characteristics [29]. We modeled estimates of the number of polyps and their characteristics in order to estimate the average, guideline based, years to OC rescreen.

The CTC guidelines of the ACR [23], the ACS [28], and the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer recommend that patients with polyps 6+ mm (small and large) are to be offered follow-up OC [29]. The ACS guideline acknowledges that some patients with small polyps will opt for surveillance. We assumed that 100% of the CTC patients with large polyps and 50% of patients with small polyps will have follow-up OC. The 50% assumptions are in the range reported informally by practicing CTC radiologists, although given the lack of published data, we tested alternative rates via scenario testing.

The CTC guidelines of the ACG and the ACS recommend CTC every 5 years, and the Working Group on Virtual Colonoscopy recommends CTC every 5–10 years [23, 30, 31, 38]. Since the ACR [39] does not recommend reporting diminutive polyps, we assume a 5-year interval for individuals with no polyps or diminutive polyps. The CTC guidelines are not specific, however, for the rescreening intervals of patients with previous small or large polyps. We assumed that the rescreen interval will be the minimum of the OC rescreen interval or 5 years.

We assumed CRC screening would start at age 50, which is consistent with the guideline recommendations of the USPSTF [40], the ACS [30], and the ACG [31] for most average risk individuals.3 The guidelines, however, are inconsistent for the maximum age for screening. USPSTF recommends through age 74 for most individuals. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute and the ACG are silent with respect to stop age and, as a payor, Medicare sets no upper age limit [41]. Although we observed a decline in Medicare screening colonoscopy rates after age 74, 19% of screening colonoscopies were for patients age 75–84 and 1% of colonoscopies for patients age 85 and over. We set the start and stop ages for our base scenario at ages 50 and 85, meaning that everyone receives their first screening at age 50 and no one has a screening age 85 and older.

Medicare population
CRC screening is covered under Medicare Part B. We estimated the size of the 2015 Medicare Part B population by age and sex by adjusting the Medicare Part B enrollment from the 2013 Medicare 100% Sample [18] by the ratio of 2015 [42] and 2013 [43] population estimates. We estimated the size of the entire Medicare Part B population. Medicare indirectly pays for the cost of CRC screening for Medicare Advantage enrollees via Medicare Advantage capitation payments, and such plans must cover all Medicare covered services.

Simulation model
To examine the cost differences between OC and CTC, we built a simulation model that follows a population of individuals at annual increments starting at age 50 through their screening years on an OC or a CTC path. The model assumed perfect compliance with the screening intervals specified for each scenario, without cross over between the two paths. The model used random numbers and the probabilities described in Methods and Results to determine CTC and OC findings, whether an OC patient has a biopsy, and whether a CTC patient with a small polyp has a follow-up OC. The screenings were monetized using the costs described.

We simulated a population of 10,000 individuals for each path. We weighted the resulting age-sex-specific costs and other results by the 2015 Medicare age-sex distribution to calculate Medicare population totals. We assumed no cost inflation and no discounting. The results are 2015 costs as if all 2015 Medicare enrollees had been on either a CTC or OC screening path since age 50.

We used SAS Version 9.3 for data analysis and Microsoft Excel 2010 for the simulation modeling.

Results
We identified 127,175 Medicare colonoscopies performed in 2013 (Table 2) and classified 56,578 (44%) as screening for purposes of calculating average costs. 46% of the colonoscopies were excluded because the coding indicated that they were diagnostic, 7% because they were performed on the same-day as an upper endoscopy, 2% because they were incomplete, and 1% because the Medicare enrollee was under age 50.Table 2 2013 Medicare colonoscopies

We estimated 2015 average Medicare colonoscopy screening costs of $1,035 (Table 3), using trends estimated by comparing 2013 and 2015 Medicare fees. The average cost was higher for colonoscopies with biopsies ($1212) and lower for colonoscopies without biopsies ($824). Most of the cost difference was due to the professional and technical fees for the colonoscopy and not pathology costs. Pathology costs averaged $92 for a colonoscopy with biopsy. 54% of colonoscopies have a biopsy. Costs varied depending on the colonoscopy codes, whether the colonoscopy involved separately billed anesthesia, the site of the colonoscopy (outpatient hospital, ambulatory surgical center, or physician office), the number of biopsies when there is a biopsy, the bowel preparation agent, and the providers’ locality. Under Medicare rules, twilight sedation administered by the colonoscopist and staff is not separately billed [44]. Deep sedation, typically propofol, must be administered by an anesthesiology professional and is separately billed [45]. 57% of colonoscopies had separately billed anesthesia costs. The average anesthesia cost per colonoscopy with a separately billed anesthesia cost was $154 ($88/57%). Bowel preparation agents were $39 of the total cost and reflect the discount that Medicare Part D plans receive compared to average wholesale prices.Table 3 2013 and 2015 Medicare average costs for screening colonoscopies

Medicare’s 2015 national fee schedule for diagnostic CTC without IV contrast is $243 (Table 4) of which $123 is professional and $120 is technical. We assumed that total 2015 cost for a screening CTC is the cost of the diagnostic CTC, the cathartic bowel preparation agent (using same cost as for OC bowel preparation—Table 3), and the cost of an OC with biopsy (Table 3) for the patients with follow-on OC. The oral contrast tagging agent(s) bowel preparation agents used specifically for CTC (in addition to the cathartic agent) is included in the Medicare fee and not separately billed.Table 4 2015 Medicare diagnostic CTC cost

Using the data sources and assumptions described in Methods and further described in the Appendix in supplementary material, we estimated that colonoscopies for male Medicare enrollees’ ages 65–74 (the decade with the highest Medicare enrollment) have approximately 10%, 12%, and 38% probabilities finding large, small, or diminutive polyps, respectively (Table 5). Probabilities for large and small polyps generally increase by age while probabilities for diminutive polyps peak at ages 60–64. Probabilities for large and small polyps were consistently lower for females than for males but were similar for diminutive polyps.Table 5 Probabilities of OC and CTC findings

Guideline recommendations imply that screening OC patients with diminutive and small polyps should be rescreened on average in 7 or 6 years, respectively. Table 6 shows the guideline and estimated average years until rescreening, rounded to the nearest integer year, for all OC and CTC polyps sizes. The literature indicates that rescreens often occur sooner than recommended by guidelines [46]; scenario 8 tests the impact of more frequent rescreens.Table 6 Years to rescreen based on OC and CTC findings

As of 2015, there are nearly 43 million Medicare enrollees’ ages 50–84 with Part B or Part C coverage, which provides payment for colorectal cancer screening. Nearly ½ (45.8%) of the enrollees are of ages 65–74 and the majority of those are of ages 65–69. Table 7 summarizes our estimated 2015 Medicare population by sex and 5-year age bands.

Table 8 summarizes the population-level statistics for the base simulation. If all of the 2015 Medicare enrollees had adhered with either OC or CTC screening guidelines (paths) since the age of 50, we estimate that there would be 5.5 million OCs or 9.1 CTCs performed in 2015. The volume difference is the result of an average time to rescreen of 8.0 years for OC and 4.9 years for CTC.Table 8 Base simulation summary statistics for the 2015 Medicare population

The higher volume of CTC screenings is offset by a substantially lower price. The average OC screening costs $1,036 and the average CTC screening costs $439, inclusive of the follow-up OC costs for 12.9% of the CTC screens that receive follow-up OC. We estimated that fully screening all Medicare enrollees charged $5.7 billion for the OC path and $4.0 billion for the CTC path, $9.34 per Medicare enrollee per month for OC and $6.59 for CTC. CTC is 29% less costly (Table 9).Table 9 Base simulation results for the 2015 Medicare population

Scenario tests and results
To understand the model sensitivity to certain assumptions and potential changes to OC and CTC standards and practices, we tested several alternative scenarios. Table 10 describes the scenarios (with more detail provided in the Appendix in supplementary material) and explains why we selected them. Table 11 summarizes the results of the scenarios.Table 10 Alternative scenarios

Description	Alternative model inputs	Explanation	
1. Fewer large and small polyps	Apply a 0.80 adjustment factor to the probability of large and small polyps and increase the probability of diminutive size polyps by the same amount so that the probability of finding a polyp of any size remains unchanged	Our base scenario, using data centered at approximately 2005, produces an approximately 18% aggregate probability of a large or small polyp finding. We have found smaller studies that indicate an aggregate probability in the 13–15% range [47–49]. Since the probability of finding a polyp of any size, however, uses recent data we left the total probability unchanged	
2. Add costs for OC and CTC complications and CTC extra-colonic findings	OC costs: add $20 and $96 to OC without and with biopsy costs, respectively, for OC complications	We used published literature [50], trended to 2015, to estimate the costs of complications and the follow-up diagnosis costs of CTC extra-colonic findings. OC has more complications than CTC and within OC, OCs with biopsies have substantially more complications than OCs without biopsies [47, 49, 51]. See Appendix in supplementary material for more details. The ACR currently recommends the reporting of potentially significant extra-colonic findings [23]	
CTC costs: add $131 to CTC for CTC complications and extra-colonic findings	
3. Increase anesthesia use for OC	Assume that 80% of OCs will have separately billed anesthesia, a 40% increase in use and costs from the 57% base scenario assumption	In 2013 separately billed anesthesia was subject to Medicare cost sharing; as of January 1, 2015 it is no longer subject to cost sharing [52]. Anesthesia use may therefore increase over the next couple of years	
4. Add costs for CTC shared decision making	Add a $20 cost to all CTCs and another $20 cost to CTCs with small polyps	Medicare covers CT lung cancer screening with the provision that the first screening must include a documented shared decision making consultation [53]. If Medicare adopts a similar approach for CTC screening, two consultations may be required: the first for the screening and the second for the decision for follow-up OC if the patient has small polyps.

Scenarios 1 through 9 produce CTC savings ranging from 12% to 58% compared to the base scenario savings of 29%. The 12% savings (scenario 2) results from including estimates, using data from published research, for the costs of OC and CTC complications and CTC extra-colonic findings. Extra-colonic findings add costs only to CTCs and complications add more costs to OC than CTC. While complications never benefit the patient, CTC extra-colonic findings, such as early detection of other cancers or abdominal aorticaneurysm may benefit the patient.

The cost advantage of CTC to OC diminishes when more CTC patients with small polyps have follow-up OC rather than surveillance or when CTC screenings are accompanied with shared decision making consultations. The impact of increasing from 50% to 75% the CTC patients with small polyps having follow-up OC (scenario 7) is similar to the impact of the shared decision encounter (scenario 4). Both reduce CTC savings by about 4% (25% savings compared to 29% for the base scenario). The cost impact is linear. Therefore, the impact of 100% of CTC patients with small polyps having follow-up OC or $40 shared decision costs is 8% (21% savings compared to 29% for the base scenario).

Scenarios 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9 increase the cost advantage of CTC to OC. Scenario 9 assumes CTC screening at the same intervals as OC. The scenario is included to compare the per-screen costs of OC and CTC without consideration of the costs resulting from more frequent CTC screenings. On a per-screen basis, inclusive of the costs for patients with large and small polyps having follow-up OC, CTC is nearly 60% less costly than OC screening.

Discussion
For a Medicare population, when compared to OC, CTC satisfies the third goal of the triple aim: reducing the per capita cost of health care. For our base scenario, CTC is 29% less costly than OC per Medicare enrollee. Although the CTC cost advantage is quite variable under the alternative scenarios, the cost advantage is positive for all alternative scenarios (range: 12–58%).

Our methodology assumes perfect enrollee adherence to either an OC or CTC path with no cross over between paths. This assumption facilitates the cost comparison. In reality, some Medicare enrollees will not be screened, others will be screened too often or for too many years, and others will cross between paths [46, 54, 55]. Because it is less invasive, CTC may have higher compliance than OC [11, 12]. We did not consider any of these possibilities in our analysis.

We identified in the historical Medicare data that 2% of colonoscopies were coded as incomplete, as defined by the failure to advance the scope past the splenic fixture [56]. Medicare reimbursement for incomplete colonoscopies is about 1/3 of that for a complete colonoscopy [24]; a subsequent complete colonoscopy is paid at the full rate [56]. With CTC, there is no colonoscope to advance, and a CTC can always visualize the entire colon, although sometimes with suboptimal assessment [57]. As such, CTCs are rarely incomplete in the same sense. Although we did not consider this difference in our modeling, a lower rate of incomplete CTC screenings relative to OC screenings would further favor CTC over OC when comparing quality and cost.

We note that the probabilities we assign to polyp size findings are “memoryless”—findings from the last screening, including findings of adenomatous polyps, do not impact the modeled probabilities of findings for the next screening. If the existence of prior polyps affects the probability of future polyps, or removal of diminutive polyps reduces the future appearance of small and large polyps, then our results would need reconsideration. Empirical data on this issue are quite limited.

Prior cost-effectiveness analyses vary in their reported results but have generally shown that CTC screening is cost-effective especially compared with no screening [58]. When typical non-Medicare charges and extra-colonic findings (e.g., abdominal aortic aneurysms) are considered, the cost-effectiveness of CTC increases further relative to OC [59]. Equivalence of clinical efficacy for colorectal evaluation between CTC and OC is well established [49, 60, 61].

Separate modeling is required for non-Medicare populations. Commercial insurance, Medicaid, other insurer, and direct-bill costs are substantially different and often higher than Medicare costs with inconsistent cost differentials by service. In particular, commercial insurers generally pay much higher fees for anesthesia and OC than does Medicare. Future changes in Medicare fee schedules and payment methodologies, Medicare assigning a screening CTC fee schedule payment different than the current diagnostic CTC fee schedule, or changes in OC or CTC screening guidelines and practices may increase or decrease the cost advantage of CTC over OC.

The aim of the study was to determine the sonographic prevalence of benign focal liver lesions on the basis of a population of hospital patients.

Methods

The ultrasound results in a population of (n = 45,319) hospital patients over a period of 10 years were examined retrospectively and evaluated for the diagnosis of benign focal liver lesions [hepatic cysts, hepatic hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), hepatic adenoma, and focal fatty sparing]. Results that were incomplete or ambiguous were excluded from this study.

Results
At least one of the lesions to be investigated was diagnosed in 15.1% (n = 6839) of the patients of the total population. The most commonly recorded lesion, with a total prevalence of 6.3% (n = 2839), was focal fatty sparing, followed by hepatic cysts with 5.8% (n = 2631). The prevalence of hepatic hemangioma was 3.3% (n = 1640), while that of FNH was 0.2% (n = 81) and that of hepatic adenoma was 0.04% (n = 19). An association between the occurrence of benign focal liver lesions and age was observed.

Conclusions
The calculated prevalence of benign focal liver lesions shows that on the fortuitous discovery of space-occupying lesions of the liver, first consideration should be given to focal fatty sparing, simple hepatic cysts and hemangiomas. The finding of a FNH or an adenoma is rarely a random discovery.

==== Body
Abdominal ultrasound, particularly of the liver, is a widely available, inexpensive technique that can be rapidly performed without exposing the patient to radiation. It is therefore the method of choice in primary diagnostic investigations in most specialist areas of medicine, but especially for imaging the abdomen [1]. Due to the continuously improving technical standard of ultrasound equipment and the high number of abdominal ultrasound examinations, the number of—often fortuitously—discovered focal liver lesions, the so-called “incidentalomas,” is also increasing markedly [2]. The investigating physician is therefore increasingly faced with the problem of differentiating between malignant and benign space-occupying processes and of distinguishing the various lesions from each other [2–4]. It is important for the subsequent diagnosis and therapy and the associated expended time and effort of the treating physician and the affected patient—to say nothing of the related costs—that the focus visible on ultrasound is classified as reliably as possible [4]. Besides the clinical parameters and the patient’s medical history, the quality of the ultrasound equipment used and the investigator’s experience also play a significant role. 57% of all liver lesions found by ultrasound are benign [5]. Therefore, a fundamental knowledge of the prevalence and image morphology of hepatic hemangiomas, hepatic cysts, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), hepatic adenoma, and focal fatty sparing is essential. The number of recent ultrasound studies on the prevalence of benign liver lesions is relatively limited. In the past 10 years, comparatively few ultrasound-based studies have appeared on this subject [6–9]. Comparison of the study results is also difficult, because the studies differ with regard to the selection of the population investigated, the number of individuals investigated, and the diagnostic method used [ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or autopsy]. This is also ultimately reflected in the prevalence rates determined in the respective studies. Published values for the prevalence of hepatic hemangiomas range from 0.1% to 20.0% [6, 7, 10, 11] and those for hepatic cysts from 0.06% to 17.8% [7, 9, 10]. Only a few studies have determined the prevalence of FNH, hepatic adenoma and focal fatty sparing. The prevalence of FNH lies between 0.8% and 3.2% [12–15], of hepatic adenoma from 0.4% to 1.5% [11, 12, 15, 16], and of focal fatty sparing between 7.2% and 19.8% [8, 17, 18]. Several studies on the prevalence of focal liver lesions are primarily concerned with just one individual type of lesion or they investigate the prevalence for a given pre-existing disease [11, 19–21]. In addition, many studies on the prevalence of benign space-occupying lesions of the liver were conducted in the 1990’s or earlier, i.e., at a time when the image quality of the ultrasound devices used was greatly inferior [17, 21–23]. Without continually carrying out new studies at regular intervals, no comparative statements concerning possible changes in the prevalence of benign focal liver lesions over time are possible.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of hepatic hemangioma, FNH, hepatic cysts, focal fatty sparing, and hepatic adenoma in a large population of university hospital patients and to compare this with the values published in the literature.

Methods
Data of 45,319 patients (48.5% women and 51.48% men) were analyzed using a PC-based, standardized documentation system (ViewPoint GE Healthcare GmbH Wessling/Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany). Patients had consecutively presented from January 2003 to November 2013 and had undergone abdominal ultrasound for a variety of diseases or for preventive medical examination in the university hospital. Inclusion criterion for this analysis was a positive sonographic diagnosis of benign focal liver lesions (hepatic cysts, hepatic hemangioma, FNH, hepatic adenoma and focal fatty sparing; Figs. 1, 2, 34 and 5). Results with inadequate or incomprehensible written or visual documentation of the finding were excluded from the study. Patients with polycystic liver diseases were excluded from this study. Ultrasound results typical of adenomas and FNH were only included in the evaluation, if these had been confirmed by further imaging or histology. The diagnosis of FNH was confirmed primarily by CEUS. At further existing unclarity, an MRI was performed in unclear findings at MRI puncture of the lesions were attempted.Fig. 1 Focal fatty sparing

All ultrasonographic examinations were performed in the ultrasound unit by experienced physicians. Examinations were performed using following devices: Philips HDI 3000, HDI 5000, IU22, Toshiba Aplio 500, and Siemens Acuson S3000. The used probes are C2-5, C1-5, and C1-6 (1–6 MHz). All lesions were examined also by color and power Doppler ultrasound. The liver was examined in inter- and/or subcostal planes with a fan-like motion allowing assessment of both the hepatic parenchyma and the intrahepatic bile ducts.

Following parameters were recorded and evaluated on the basis of the above-mentioned research question: positive/negative finding, nature of tumor, age and gender of the patient, number of foci (solitary, multiple), the respective ultrasound characteristics of the focus and size of the tumor (maximum diameter). The number of focal lesions was considered separately up to a figure of five lesions. From six or more foci upwards, these were combined as “more than five lesions.” The information about lesion size was based on the maximum measurable diameter in each case. If no unequivocal and/or acceptable statements about the above-mentioned parameters could be made from the re-inspected ultrasound images, these were expanded and/or measured again. Used criteria for the diagnosis of the lesions are presented in Table 1.Table 1 Criteria Used to Diagnose Each Lesion Type

The study was conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the recommendations of Good Clinical Practice. The project received a positive opinion from the local ethics committee (No. 377/13).

The statistical calculations were carried out using the statistics software SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA) and the data evaluated using descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, the mean and standard deviation were calculated, while categorical attributes were presented in absolute and relative frequencies. In order to demonstrate differences between patients with and without a lesion, the Wilcoxon signed rank-sum test was applied for continuous variables and the χ2 test for categorical variables, unless the sample size was too small, in which case Fisher’s exact test was used. The level of significance was set at α = 5%, and the p value was given to four decimal places.

Results
Between 01/2003 and 11/2013, the liver was examined by ultrasound in a total of 45,319 patients, of whom 48.5% were women (n = 21,988) and 51.48% men (n = 23 331). The mean age of patients at the time of the investigation was 56 ± 18.1 years (range: 4 months–105 years). On average, women were aged 56.1 ± 18.8 years and men 55.9 ± 17.4 years. At least one of the lesions of interest was found in a total of 6851 patients (15.1% of the population examined). A total of 44.9% of these patients were outpatients and 55.1% inpatients. The most common lesion was focal fatty sparing, which was diagnosed in 2839 cases, corresponding to a prevalence of 6.3%. It was most often found in the 51–60 years age group; the mean age of the patients with focal fatty sparing was 54.9 ± 14.5 years. Age-specific prevalence was far less apparent in the younger age groups and in the elderly. Men were affected much more often (63.5%) than women (36.5%). The mean maximum measured size of the focal fatty sparing was 20.6 mm. All the cases of focal fatty sparing that we encountered were solitary findings in its typical location in liver segment IV in the region of the gallbladder bed. The age-dependent frequency of hepatic steatosis and the related prevalence of focal fatty sparing in patients with hepatic steatosis were also determined (Table 2). The frequency of focal fatty sparing in patients with hepatic steatosis decreased with age and in the youngest age group of patients with hepatic steatosis, namely under 30 years of age, the specific prevalence of focal fatty sparing was over 90%. In our study, this figure fell almost linearly with increasing age and amounted to only 66.8% in the group of patients over 70 years of age.Table 2 Age-Specific Prevalence of Focal Fatty Sparing in Hepatic Steatosis

The second most commonly diagnosed liver lesion was the hepatic cyst, with 5.8% (n = 2631). Hepatic cysts became more common with age. The youngest patient group, under 30 years of age, was scarcely affected, with an age-specific prevalence of 0.8% (n = 21). Most hepatic cysts were found in the oldest patients, with a frequency of 38.5% (n = 1012). The mean age was 64.7 years. Women were somewhat more affected (56.1%, n = 1477) than men (43.9%, n = 1154). The largest measured cyst diameter averaged 22.3 mm. Solitary cysts were found in 62.8% (n = 1652) of cases.

In our patient population, the prevalence of hepatic hemangioma was 3.6% (n = 1640). As regards the age distribution, the respective age-specific prevalence began with 7.0% (n = 115) in the youngest patients and rose to a maximum of 22.5% (n = 369) of all discovered hemangiomas in the age group between 51 and 60 years. Lower prevalence was again determined in the highest age groups. The gender distribution of hemangioma was almost balanced, with 53.4% (n = 879) women/46.6% (n = 761) men. 76.67% (n = 1157) of diagnosed hemangiomas were solitary, and the average size of the hemangiomas was 20.1 mm.

The prevalence of FNH was 0.2% (n = 81). The highest prevalence was found in younger women, and 86.4% (n = 70) of all patients with FNH were females. The peak age for FNH occurred in the youngest patient group with 34.6% (n = 28) of the diagnosed lesions and fell continuously with increasing age. Multiple FNHs were rare; the prevalence of solitary FNHs was 88.9% (n = 72), and the average size was 51.6 mm.

With only 19 cases and hence a prevalence of 0.04%, hepatic adenoma was the rarest of the liver lesions we investigated. Overall, more adenomas were diagnosed in the younger patient groups under 50 years of age than in the older ones. In our population, a maximum occurred at between 41 and 50 years of age. 84.2% (n = 16) of patients with adenoma were women. Apart from 2 exceptions, all diagnosed adenomas were solitary findings (89.5%, n = 17). The mean size was 39.0 mm (Table 3).Table 3 Results on the Prevalence and Epidemiological Distribution of Benign Liver Lesions

Discussion
Studies concerning the prevalence of benign focal liver lesions present a quite heterogeneous picture as regards the precise research question posed, the size of the population studied, and the investigative methods used. It is therefore difficult to compare the various study results and apply them to routine ultrasound primary diagnostics. For example, the prevalence of hepatic hemangioma determined in the studies ranged from 0.1% to 20.0% and that of hepatic cysts from 0.06% to 17.8%. Only a very few studies investigated the prevalence of FNH, hepatic adenoma, and focal fatty sparing. The prevalence figures reported in previous ultrasound studies for FNH were 0.8%–3.2% and for hepatic adenoma 0.4%–1.5% [8, 15, 17, 20].

Liver areas with reduced focal, rarely zonal accumulation of fat can occur in hepatic steatosis. The most common site of these pseudo lesions are hepatic segments IV and V, the gallbladder bed, the falciform ligament region, and ventral to the portal vein. In rare cases, focal fatty sparing has also been described in other liver segments where, in the first instance, it is generally difficult to distinguish from malignant lesions and can hence pose considerable problems for a differential diagnosis [24–26]. To date, only a few studies have been published on the prevalence of focal fatty sparing or of focal fat distribution disorders in the liver [8, 27]. Kratzer et al. calculated a value of 9.05% in a random population collective [8]. The research group of Koseoglu reported a prevalence of focal fatty sparing of up to 19.8 [18] Strunk et al. reported a prevalence of 7.2% in a population of patients with colorectal carcinoma [17]. Our result of 6.3% is below the prevalence figures of Kratzer et al. and Strunk et al. [8, 17]. The size and age structure of the respective study populations, as well as the quality of the ultrasound equipment used, need to be considered here. As also found by Aubin et al., one possible cause could be the lower clustering of focal fatty sparing in patients with status post cholecystectomy, whose number increases with age and occurs more frequently in a hospital population than in a random sample of the entire population [24].

Considerably more studies have investigated the prevalence of hepatic hemangioma than of focal fatty sparing, FNH, and adenoma [6, 7, 9, 11, 21]. The majority of the more recent ultrasound-based prevalence studies show significantly higher prevalence figures than older ultrasound-based studies (Table 4). Our prevalence figure of 3.6% for hemangioma lies in the mid-range compared to the previously published results from ultrasound-based studies [6, 7, 9, 17]. In comparison with CT, MRI, and autopsy studies, which show a far higher range of prevalence, our figure is in the lower third [10, 11, 19, 20]. The highest prevalence figures were reported from autopsy and CT studies [12, 15, 19, 28]. In terms of the age distribution and average size, our results correspond to those of comparable studies [13, 19]. Gandolfi et al. described a higher prevalence of hemangioma in middle aged or older patients, while Rungsinaporn et al. reported a higher prevalence of hepatic hemangioma in women—resulting that we were unable to corroborate with our data (Table 3) [21, 29].Table 4 Ultrasound Studies on the Prevalence of Focal Liver Lesions

As with hemangioma, there are a comparatively large number of prevalence studies for hepatic cysts, but they also differ in terms of study size, patient populations investigated, and diagnostic techniques used. Retrospective and prospective studies based on ultrasound have reported prevalence data for hepatic cysts of between 0.1% and 11.3% [7, 9, 23, 29]. With our determined prevalence of 5.8%, we are also here in the mid-range. In the case of hepatic cysts, the range of prevalence figures from CT, MRI, or autopsy studies is also much wider than that of the ultrasound-based studies [5, 10, 15, 19, 30]. In relation to the CT, MRI, and autopsy studies, our prevalence is in the mid to lower third of the range. CT-supported studies have reported the highest figures for prevalence [15, 19]. In line with our results, all studies reported a higher prevalence of hepatic cysts with increasing age [19, 22, 23, 30]. Most studies have also found a gender-dependent aspect, with higher prevalence figures for hepatic cysts in women [22, 23, 29, 30]. Our measured mean cyst size of 2.2 cm corresponds to the values published in the literature [19, 22, 23, 30].

There are only a few studies on the prevalence of FNH [12–15]. The prevalence figures of the two ultrasound-based studies for FNH were 0.8% and 1.8% and lie below the figures of between 1.8% and 3.2% reported from CT, MRI, or pathological investigations [12–15]. Our figure of 0.18% is markedly lower than the data published to date. This difference can be related to the population size and age of the patients studied [13, 14]. Through higher performance ultrasound equipment and the introduction of contrast-enhanced ultrasound, the diagnosis of FNH can nowadays be made with higher sensitivity and specificity [31].

There are no ultrasound studies on the prevalence of hepatic adenoma within a large patient population. Furthermore, there are only a few prevalence studies based on CT, MRI investigations, and autopsy studies [11, 12, 15, 16]. The prevalence data published so far on hepatic adenoma are between 0.4% and 1.7%. The understanding of hepatic adenoma has changed fundamentally in recent years [32, 33]. Through the division into four different genotypic subtypes, new aspects have emerged concerning prevalence and clinical presentation. Naturally, these cannot be recorded in retrospective ultrasound prevalence studies. The prevalence of 0.04% determined by us is considerably lower than that found in the previous studies. As was already put forward as a possible explanation in the case of FNH, this could be due to the age of the study participants, the size of the patient population investigated, and the improved differentiation possibilities of modern ultrasound equipment. Unfortunately, we cannot compare our results on age and gender distribution or those concerning the average size of the hepatic adenoma with any of the studies available to us. However, the occurrence of a hepatic adenoma is associated with the ingestion of oral contraceptives, which may be reflected in our results, since we found the majority of adenomas in women aged below 50 years [34].

Conclusions
In summary, our results show that the first possibility to be considered on the incidental discovery of space-occupying lesions of the liver—especially if hepatic steatosis is present—is focal fatty sparing. Simple hepatic cysts and hemangiomas are the most common focal liver lesions. The finding of a FNH or an adenoma is rarely a fortuitous result.
